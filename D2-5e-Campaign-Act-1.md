# Using This Guide

This campaign guide is organized to facilitate both preparation and play. The structure follows a logical flow from the starting point (Rogue Encampment) through quest progression, area exploration, and combat encounters.
:
**Book Structure:**
1. **Rogue Encampment & NPCs** - The starting location with all non-player characters, their services, and dialogue
2. **Main Quests** - Detailed quest write-ups with objectives, encounters, and rewards
3. **Area Descriptions** - Locations with descriptive text, encounter tables, and cross-references
4. **Monsters & Creatures** - Complete stat blocks for all enemies in Act I
5. **Magic Items** - Unique items, set items, gems, runes, and charms for treasure distribution
6. **Appendix** - Additional tables, references, and tools

**Cross-References:** Throughout this guide, you'll find references like *"See page XX for more information"*. These will be updated with actual page numbers once the document is finalized. For now, use section headers to navigate.

**Encounter Tables:** Each area includes a d20 encounter table. Roll once per hour of travel or exploration, or when the party enters a new section of an area. The DM may choose encounters narratively instead of rolling.

**Magic Items:** The magic items section provides examples and templates. DMs are encouraged to modify or create new items based on player preferences and campaign needs.


# The World of Sanctuary

##### A Land Between Heaven and Hell

**Sanctuary** is a world born of desperation and hidden by necessity. Created by the renegade angels Inarius and the demon Lilith as a refuge from the Eternal Conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, it has become a battleground where both sides vie for dominance. The mortal races—humans and their kin—know little of their world's true origins. To them, Sanctuary is simply home, a place of struggle, survival, and sometimes, hope.

But hope is in short supply these days. The Prime Evils—Diablo, Mephisto, and Baal—have returned, their influence spreading across the land like a plague. Where they walk, corruption follows. The dead rise, demons pour forth from the depths, and even the land itself sickens and dies. It is a time of darkness, and those who would stand against it are few and desperate.

**The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye** was once a bastion of order and protection. Their home was the Monastery, a fortress that stood watch over the western lands. But Andariel, the Maiden of Anguish, came. She corrupted them from within, twisted their purpose, turned sister against sister. Most fell. Some were transformed into monsters. A few escaped, fleeing to a makeshift encampment in the wilderness, where they cling to survival even as their world collapses around them.

This is where your story begins. In the shadow of a lost home, surrounded by corruption, with the darkness closing in. The heroes who answer the call are all that stands between Sanctuary and damnation. But whether they can stem the tide—whether they can even survive—remains to be seen.

## The Events of Act I

##### The Corruption Spreads

**Act I** of the Diablo II campaign takes place in the western lands of Sanctuary, where the corruption is newest and most violent. The adventure begins in the **Rogue Encampment**, the last refuge of what remains of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye.

**The Current Situation:**

The western lands have been overrun by demonic forces. The **Blood Moor**, once peaceful farmland, is now a warzone. The **Cold Plains** are frozen wastelands. The **Burial Grounds** give up their dead as restless undead. The **Monastery**, the Rogues' former home, has been taken by Andariel's forces and turned into a fortress of darkness.

**The Threat:**

**Andariel**, the Maiden of Anguish, rules from the depths beneath the Monastery. One of the Lesser Evils who answered Diablo's call, she specializes in breaking the spirit—showing her victims everything they've lost. Under her influence, the corrupted lands spawn endless horrors—Fallen demons, risen dead, corrupted beasts, and worse.

**The Heroes' Mission:**

The party arrives at the Rogue Encampment seeking answers, seeking a place to make a stand. They'll be asked to:
- Clear the Den of Evil, a cave infested with Fallen demons
- Hunt down Blood Raven, a corrupted Rogue raising the dead
- Rescue Deckard Cain, the last Horadrim, from the cursed town of Tristram
- Explore the Forgotten Tower, hunting for rare treasures
- Retrieve the Horadric Malus, an ancient tool of power
- Finally, face Andariel herself in the depths of the Cathedral Catacombs

**What's at Stake:**

If Andariel isn't stopped, the corruption will spread unchecked. The Prime Evils will gain a foothold that may prove impossible to dislodge. But even if the heroes succeed, the war is far from over. The Prime Evils still threaten the East, and Sanctuary's fate hangs in the balance.

## Running the Adventure

##### For the Game Master

**Tone and Atmosphere:**

This campaign thrives on atmosphere. Play up the desperation, the corruption, the sense that the world is falling apart. The Rogue Encampment should feel like the last flicker of light in an ocean of darkness. Use descriptive language, play up the environmental details, and don't be afraid to let things feel hopeless—it makes the victories more meaningful.

**Pacing:**

Act I is designed for characters starting at **1st level** and progressing to **5th-6th level** by the end. The adventure can be run as written, but feel free to adjust encounter difficulty based on your party's composition and skill level. The encounters are designed to be challenging but not overwhelming for a typical party.

**Non-Linear Exploration:**

While there are main quests, the wilderness areas are open for exploration. Players can (and should) wander off the beaten path. Use the encounter tables to generate random encounters as they explore, and don't be afraid to let them discover areas out of order. Some of the best moments come from unexpected discoveries.

**NPCs and Roleplay:**

The NPCs in the Rogue Encampment are more than quest givers—they're survivors, people who have lost everything. Let them show their fear, their hope, their desperation. The party's actions should matter to these people. When they succeed, let the NPCs show relief, gratitude, renewed hope. When they fail... well, let the consequences be felt.

**Combat Balance:**

The creatures in Act I are dangerous, but they follow patterns. Fallen fight in packs with shamans. Skeletons use formation tactics. Corrupted Rogues are fast and deadly. Teach players to prioritize targets, manage resources, and work together. If they're struggling, have NPCs offer advice or healing.
}}

**Player Death:**

This is a dark campaign, and death is a real possibility. However, don't feel obligated to kill characters unnecessarily. Consider:
- NPCs (like Akara) offering resurrection services at a cost
- Allowing characters to be captured or left for dead instead of killed
- Having powerful NPCs (like Deckard Cain) intervene in extreme situations
- Using the party's mercenaries as buffers against permanent losses

::::::::::::

**Rewards and Progression:**

Reward exploration and clever problem-solving, not just combat. Players who investigate areas thoroughly, talk to NPCs, or find creative solutions should be rewarded with information, items, or experience. The magic items section provides plenty of loot, but feel free to customize based on your players' needs.

**Adapting the Adventure:**

This campaign is a framework, not a script. If your players want to spend time crafting, trading, or roleplaying, let them. If they want to skip certain areas or pursue side quests, adjust accordingly. The encounters are guidelines—feel free to modify them, add new ones, or remove ones that don't fit your game.

**Connecting to Future Acts:**

Act I sets up the larger story. When players defeat Andariel, make it clear that this is just the beginning. The Prime Evils are still out there, and the East holds new threats. Warriv's caravan can take them there... when they're ready.

**Key Themes to Emphasize:**

- **Loss and Recovery:** Everything has been lost, but hope can be rebuilt
- **Corruption:** Evil spreads like a disease, twisting everything it touches
- **Sacrifice:** Standing against darkness requires giving everything
- **Determination:** Even in the darkest times, heroes can make a difference

**Final Notes:**

Remember that this is a game, and fun comes first. If something isn't working, change it. If your players want to do something unexpected, let them. The adventure is a tool to facilitate storytelling, not a constraint. Use it to create memorable moments, tell a compelling story, and give your players the chance to be heroes in a world that desperately needs them.

{{descriptive
The last gasp of civilization—canvas tents flapping in a cold, uncanny wind, wooden spike walls creaking like they know they won’t hold forever. The place has the energy of a refugee shelter turned war outpost: Rogues whisper over campfires, blacksmith hammers ring through the smoke, and the scent of damp earth mixes with steel and desperation. It’s not a town, not a sanctuary—more like a battlefield pause, the flicker of humanity trying to survive on the doorstep of Hell. It's the kind of place where you feel safe only because the monsters haven’t noticed you yet.

{{wide
##### Area Overview
#
The Rogue Encampment is less a settlement than a desperate holding action—a collection of tents, makeshift structures, and the burned-out ruins of what might have once been a small trading post. The encampment sits on a slight rise overlooking the Blood Moor, its position chosen for visibility rather than comfort. A rough palisade of sharpened stakes surrounds the perimeter, but it feels more like a psychological barrier than a physical one—a line drawn in the earth that says *"here, at least, we try."*

Within the encampment, life goes on with a grim determination. Tents are arranged in a loose circle around a central fire pit that never quite goes out. The blacksmith's forge, sheltered under a canvas awning, rings with the sound of hammer on metal from dawn until dusk. Merchant stalls line what passes for a street, their wares meager but essential. The encampment has no permanent structures save for the ruins themselves, and even those have been repurposed—storage, makeshift armories, places to rest out of the wind.

The residents move with purpose, but there's a weariness that hangs over everything. These are people who have lost everything and are clinging to what little remains. They are survivors, refugees, and warriors all at once, bound together by necessity and loss. The encampment is their last stand, a final declaration that they will not go quietly into the darkness that has consumed everything else.
}}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Residents

Despite their losses, the encampment is home to a handful of key figures, each playing a crucial role in the survival of what remains:

**Akara** — The priestess and spiritual leader of the encampment. She offers healing, guidance, and the first quest to adventurers willing to help. Her tent sits near the center, a small altar to the Light the only sign of hope in this dark place. *(See page XX for full details)*

**Kashya** — Captain of the remaining Rogues, a hardened warrior who has seen too much death. She stands watch over the eastern approaches, ever vigilant, her bow never far from hand. She recruits mercenaries and offers missions to those who prove themselves. *(See page XX for full details)*

**Charsi** — The blacksmith, barely out of her teens but carrying the weight of a lost monastery. She escaped when Andariel overran their home, bringing only her tools and her knowledge. Now she works from dawn until dusk, forging weapons for the fight against the darkness. *(See page XX for full details)*

**Gheed** — A merchant and opportunist who has made a life of finding profit in crisis. His cluttered stall offers weapons, armor, and supplies—for a price. He also deals in "mystery boxes," sealed containers of unknown contents for the adventurous and the desperate. *(See page XX for full details)*

**Warriv** — The caravan leader, a man defined by movement and now trapped by circumstance. His wagons sit at the edge of the encampment, ready to travel East once the way is clear. He knows the routes to Lut Gholein and beyond, if only the roads were safe again. *(See page XX for full details)*

**Deckard Cain** — The last Horadrim, rescued from Tristram's cursed ruins. An ancient scholar burdened by knowledge, he provides item identification and lore about the Prime Evils and the true nature of the threat facing Sanctuary. He arrives after his rescue from Tristram. *(See page XX for full details)*

These few, along with the handful of other Rogues who escaped the Monastery, are all that remain of what was once a proud and powerful order. Each has lost friends, family, everything they held dear. But they refuse to surrender, and in that refusal, there is strength—and perhaps, hope.

## Akara, the Priestess

{{wide
##### The Light That Remains

**Akara** is the spiritual heart of the Rogue Encampment, though that heart beats with a weariness that comes from having given too much, for too long. She moves through the camp with quiet purpose, her simple robes of undyed cloth marking her as something different from the warriors and merchants around her. Her hands bear the calluses of someone who has worked as much as she has prayed—binding wounds, brewing potions, tending to the spiritual needs of people who have lost everything.

Her tent is set near the center of the encampment, a place of relative peace in the chaos. Inside, simple furnishings surround an altar to the Light—a small thing, but one that she maintains with devotion. Healing supplies are organized with care, and herbs hang drying from the tent poles, filling the space with the scent of earth and medicine. This is where she tends the wounded, where she offers what comfort she can, and where she tries to hold onto faith in a world that seems determined to snuff it out.

Akara's face shows the weight of her responsibilities. She's older than she once was, her features lined with worry and loss. But her eyes still hold a spark—not hope, exactly, but something stubborn, a refusal to surrender to despair. She speaks quietly, but every word carries the weight of someone who has spent her life in service to something greater than herself.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Initial Meeting:**

**Akara:** *"Welcome, strangers. I am Akara, priestess of this... place we now call home."* She gestures to the encampment with a tired sweep of her hand. *"We have few blessings left to count, but your arrival might be one. These lands have been overrun by demons and their twisted servants. What was once a peaceful frontier is now a battlefield."*

*"I do not ask for help lightly, but we are desperate. There is a cave not far from here—we call it the Den of Evil. It has become a nest for these creatures, a breeding ground for darkness. Every day, more of them pour forth from that place, and we grow weaker."*

*"If you are willing to help, clear that den. Destroy every last creature within it. Only then can we begin to feel secure, even for a moment. In return, I can offer you what little we have—my blessing, and a small gift of power that might aid you in the trials to come."*

**Healing Service:**

**Akara:** *"Come, sit. Let me tend to your wounds."* Her hands move with practiced ease as she checks injuries, applying salves and bandages. *"I have little to offer beyond what my faith provides, but the Light is strong, even here. Your wounds will heal, and you will be ready to face what comes next."*

*"Rest here if you need to. The encampment isn't safe—nowhere is, these days—but it's safer than the wilderness beyond. Take what time you need to recover, then return to the fight. We're all counting on you."*

**Attribute Respec Service (Limited - Once per Act):**

**Akara:** *"The path we choose shapes who we become. Sometimes, we realize we've chosen poorly, or that circumstances demand we take a different approach."* She studies the player carefully. *"I can offer you a chance to reconsider your choices, to redistribute the gifts the Light has given you. But this is not a thing to be done lightly, or often. The Light does not grant second chances freely."*

*"I can do this for you once, and only once while you remain in these lands. After that, you must live with the choices you've made, as we all must. Are you certain this is what you need?"*

**General Merchant Services:**

**Akara:** *"I have a few supplies that might aid you—healing potions, simple remedies, perhaps a scroll or two I've managed to preserve."* She gestures to a small collection of items. *"I don't have the selection of Gheed, but what I have is blessed by the Light. It will serve you well."*

*"I'll also buy what you no longer need. Even simple items might help someone else, and we can't afford to let anything go to waste. Every resource matters when you're fighting for survival."*

**Quest 1 Completion Dialogue:**

**Akara:** *"I can see it in your eyes—you've done it, haven't you? The Den is clear."* She closes her eyes and breathes deeply, as if releasing a burden she has carried too long. *"For the first time in weeks, I can feel the Light returning to this place, even if it is only a flicker."*

She reaches out and places a hand on each party member's shoulder in turn. *"You have given us hope, and for that, we are grateful. But more than hope, I can offer you this—a small blessing of power. Take this gift, and use it well. You will need every advantage in the days ahead."*

## Akara, the Priestess (Continued)
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Post-Quest Guidance:**

**Akara:** *"The Den is clear, but this is only the beginning. The darkness has spread far beyond that single cave. To the east lies the Cold Plains, and beyond that, the Burial Grounds where one of our own has been turned against us. Now she goes by the name Blood Raven."* Her voice grows hard. *"When you are ready, speak with Kashya. She has a task that needs doing, and she trusts no one but herself... until now, perhaps."*

*"The path ahead will be difficult. You'll face corruption, undead, creatures that should not exist. But remember—the Light still burns, even here. Hold onto that. It might be the only thing that keeps you going when the darkness seems overwhelming."*

**Lore and Guidance:**

**Akara:** *"The corruption that spreads across these lands—it's not natural. It's the work of demons, of creatures from the Burning Hells. They seek to break Sanctuary, to turn it into an extension of their domain."*

*"Andariel is the one behind much of this. The Maiden of Anguish. She corrupted our sisters at the Monastery, twisted them into mockeries of what they were. She feeds on despair, on loss. The more we suffer, the stronger she becomes."*

*"But even in the darkest times, there is hope. The Light has not abandoned us, and neither should we abandon it. We must fight, not just for ourselves, but for everyone who cannot fight for themselves."*

**After Andariel's Defeat:**

**Akara:** *"You did it. You actually did it. Andariel is gone, and the corruption that held these lands begins to lift."* There are tears in her eyes, but they're tears of relief, of something like joy. *"The Light has returned, in part. The Monastery... it will never be what it was, but perhaps it can be reclaimed, eventually."*

*"But this is not the end. The Prime Evils still threaten Sanctuary, and their influence extends far beyond these lands. When you travel East with Warriv, remember what you've learned here. Remember that even the smallest light can push back the darkness."*

*"You will always be welcome here, heroes. This encampment is your home as much as it is ours. May the Light guide your steps, wherever they may lead."*

## Kashya, Rogue Captain

{{wide
##### The Warrior's Burden

**Kashya** stands apart from the other residents of the encampment, her presence commanding attention even in stillness. She wears the remnants of her Rogue armor—leather reinforced with metal plates, marked with the symbols of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. Her bow is always close at hand, her quiver full, her knives strapped where they can be reached in an instant. But it's her eyes that tell the real story—they've seen too much, and they never stop scanning for threats.

She is the military leader of what remains of the Rogue Sisterhood, and the weight of that responsibility shows in every line of her body. Where Akara offers hope, Kashya offers harsh reality. She doesn't have time for pleasantries or false comfort. There are threats to face, and someone has to face them. If she seems cold, it's because warmth is a luxury she can't afford.

Kashya's tent is strategically positioned near the encampment's eastern edge, where she can keep watch over the Blood Moor. Her area is organized like a military camp—weapons maintained and ready, armor stacked for quick access, maps and reports spread across a makeshift table. She speaks little, but when she does, every word carries weight.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Initial Meeting:**

**Kashya:** *"So. You're the ones Akara's been waiting for."* Her voice is hard, like stone that's been worn smooth by weather. She doesn't turn from her watch over the Blood Moor as she speaks. *"I'm Kashya. I lead what's left of the Rogues. We are few now. Most of us fell at the Monastery, turned against us by forces we couldn't fight."*

She finally turns, and her gaze is like a physical weight. *"If you're here to help, then help. But understand this—the wilderness out there will kill you if you're not prepared. The creatures don't care about your good intentions. They only care about your death."*

*"When you're ready to do something useful, come find me. There's one of our sisters who's been corrupted. She needs to be put down before she does more damage. But first, finish whatever Akara sent you to do. I don't send people on missions they might not come back from... not if they're still learning."*

**After Quest 1 Completion:**

**Kashya:** *"I heard you cleared the Den. Good. That means you might be ready for something real."* She stands, and her movement is fluid despite the armor she wears. *"The monster now going by Blood Raven was one of our best archers. She was strong, skilled, someone we all looked up to. Now she serves the darkness, raising the dead and turning them against the living."*

*"The Burial Grounds are in the Cold Plains, northeast of here. She's there, surrounded by her victims. I need someone to go there and end her. Not just defeat her—destroy her. She's beyond saving, and every moment she exists, she corrupts more of the land."*

*"Do this for me, and I'll give you one of my scouts. They're skilled fighters, and having someone to watch your back might keep you alive long enough to be useful."*

**Recruiting a Mercenary (After Quest 2):**

**Kashya:** *"You did it. Blood Raven is gone. I... thank you. That couldn't have been easy, facing one of our own."* She takes a moment to compose herself, then gestures to a group of Rogues nearby. *"I told you I'd give you one of my scouts. These are the best I have left. Choose one, and they'll serve you faithfully."*

*"They're good fighters. Better archers than most, and they know how to move in the wilderness. They won't replace a party member, but they'll keep you from dying to an arrow in the back, or catch something you might have missed."*

___

- Limited weapon/armor trade (rogue-specific equipment)

## Charsi, the Blacksmith

{{wide
##### Forged in Loss

The sound of hammer on metal echoes through the encampment, a steady rhythm that serves as a backdrop to everything else. **Charsi** works at her forge from first light until the sun goes down, her muscular frame moving with the practiced ease of someone who has spent years at the anvil. She's younger than most of the other residents—barely out of her teens, perhaps—but her eyes carry the same weight, the same loss.

She escaped the Monastery when Andariel's forces overran it, carrying nothing but her tools and the knowledge her masters had imparted. It's all she has left, and she applies it with a determination that borders on obsession. Every weapon she repairs, every piece of armor she fixes, is one more tool in the fight against the darkness. She won't let herself think about what might have happened to her teachers, to her fellow students. There's work to do.

Her forge area is a study in organized chaos. Tools hang from hooks, half-finished projects sit waiting for attention, raw materials are stacked where they won't catch fire but are easy to reach. The fire of her forge never quite dies, kept alive by her constant work. She talks to her work sometimes, muttering about technique and quality, lost in the craft that is both her burden and her salvation.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Initial Meeting:**

**Charsi:** *"Need something fixed?"* She doesn't look up from the sword she's working on, the hammer ringing against the metal. *"I'm Charsi. I keep the weapons working and the armor whole. It's not much, but it's what I can do."*

She finally pauses, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. *"I was training at the Monastery when... when it happened. They say it was Andariel herself who came. The corruption spread through the grounds like fire, and I barely escaped. Now I'm here, fixing things, trying to make up for... well, trying to make up for whatever I couldn't do then."*

*"If you've got weapons that need repair, armor that needs patching, I can help. I've also got a few things I made—simple stuff, but solid. And if you bring me special materials, I can do more. Make weapons that actually matter against these creatures."*

**Quest 4 Hook (The Forgotten Tower):**

The quest formally begins when the heroes discover the **Moldy Tome** in the Stony Field. The tome recounts how a noblewoman—the Countess—was burned beneath her tower in the Black Marsh and points readers toward the ruins in search of her treasure. After the party reads the tome, Charsi reinforces the legend:

**Charsi:** *"So you found that old Moldy Tome, huh? Then you know about the tower in the Black Marsh—the Forgotten Tower. Abandoned, supposedly haunted. The stories say the Countess hoarded all kinds of things: rare items, artifacts, maybe even runes."*

Her eyes light up with something like hunger. *"If you're going out that way, it might be worth checking. I could use materials like that—gems, rare metals, anything special. The things I could make with proper materials..."*

She shakes herself. *"Just be careful. Places like that aren't abandoned by accident. Whatever drove people away is probably still there—and probably angrier than ever."*

**Quest 5 Dialogue (Tools of the Trade):**

**Charsi:** *"There's something I need. Something from the Monastery—or what's left of it. It's called the Horadric Malus. It's... it was a tool of my teachers, a hammer blessed by the Horadrim. They used it for their greatest works, for weapons that could strike at demons themselves."*

Her voice is tight with emotion. *"If it still exists, it should still be in the Monastery Barracks—past the Outer Cloister, in the heart of what used to be our stronghold. The Smith, a hulking demon that now forges weapons for Andariel, was last seen hauling it back there. He probably doesn't even understand what he's guarding, but he won't give it up without a fight."*

*"Bring it to me, and I'll use it to craft you something real. A weapon worthy of heroes. Something that can actually hurt these creatures, not just scratch at them."*

:
**Services:**
___
- Repair weapons and armor (cost: 10% of item's base value)
- Buy/sell weapons and armor
- Item upgrade (after Quest 5, using Horadric Malus)
- Socket items (after Quest 5, using Horadric Malus)
- Information about the Monastery and its destruction
- Simple potions and supplies

**Item Upgrade Service (After Quest 5):**
*"The Malus... you actually found it. I didn't think..."* She takes the hammer reverently, running her fingers over its surface. *"Thank you. This means more than you know."*

*"With this, I can do real work. Bring me a weapon or piece of armor, and I can improve it. Make it stronger, better. Add sockets if the material is right. This is what I was trained for, what I was meant to do."*

:
**Personality Notes:**
___
- Driven by guilt and determination
- Takes comfort in her craft
- Grief over lost mentors manifests as work obsession
- Becomes more hopeful after receiving the Horadric Malus

## Gheed, the Merchant

{{wide
##### Opportunity in Crisis

**Gheed** is a man who has made a life of finding opportunities in difficult times. He's older, his hair graying, his face lined with the marks of someone who's spent decades on the road. He wears clothes that might have been fine once but are now travel-worn and patched, and he carries himself with the confidence of someone who knows he has something others need.

His stall in the encampment is a chaotic collection of odds and ends—weapons recovered from the field, armor salvaged from the dead, potions, scrolls, and curiosities of every description. Nothing is organized in any way that makes sense, but somehow Gheed knows exactly where everything is. He's always counting, always calculating, always looking for the next deal.

Gheed is, in his own way, a survivor. He's been through crises before, and he knows that people need things—supplies, weapons, hope in the form of better equipment. He's not dishonest, exactly, but he's opportunistic. He charges what the market will bear, and right now, the market will bear quite a bit. But he's also not heartless. In a world where everything has fallen apart, his stall represents a tiny piece of normalcy, and he knows that's valuable too.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Initial Meeting:**

**Gheed:** *"Welcome, welcome! Gheed's the name, and business is my game. I've got everything you need—weapons, armor, potions, odds and ends. Quality merchandise, guaranteed!"* He spreads his hands to indicate his cluttered stall. *"I've been traveling these roads for years, and I've learned to stock the essentials."*

He leans forward conspiratorially. *"I'll be honest with you—prices aren't what they used to be. Supply and demand, you understand. But I'm fair. I'll buy what you have, sell you what you need, and maybe we can both come out ahead."*

*"I've also got something special for the adventurous type. Boxes. Sealed boxes, contents unknown. Could be junk, could be treasure. It's a gamble, but sometimes gambling pays off. Interested?"*

**General Merchant Dialogue:**

**Gheed:** *"Looking to buy? Sell? Trade? I've got weapons for every situation, armor for every occasion."*

*"Found something interesting out there? I'll take a look. Never know what might be valuable to the right buyer. And if you're in the market for something specific, I might have it—or I might know where you could find it."*

**Gambling Dialogue:**

**Gheed:** *"Ah, the boxes! I call them 'Mystery Boxes.' No, I don't know what's inside—that's the point. Could be nothing. Could be a rare gem. Could be a magic weapon. Could be a handful of copper and a moldy sandwich."*

*"Cost you a bit of gold, but that's the nature of gambling, isn't it? High risk, high reward. Or, you know, high risk and you lose your gold. But that's the fun part!"*

*"Most boxes have something useful. Maybe not always what you want, but useful. I get them from... various sources. Places people don't go anymore, things people left behind. Sometimes it's better not to ask too many questions."*

**Tristram Stories:**

**Gheed:** *"Tristram? Ah, now there's a sad story. Used to be a thriving little town. Had the best tavern this side of Lut Gholein, and a blacksmith—Griswold—who could make weapons that'd sing when you drew them."*

His expression grows distant. *"I passed through there often. Good people, peaceful place. Then... well, you know what happened. Diablo. The Prime Evil. Tristram fell, and everyone with it. Now it's just ruins and ghosts."*

*"If you're going that way, be careful. The place is cursed, haunted. And Griswold... well, they say he's still there. But he's not the man he was. Nothing that's left in Tristram is what it was."*

## Warriv, the Caravan Leader

##### The Road Goes Ever On

**Warriv** is a man defined by movement. Even when standing still, he seems to be in motion, his eyes constantly scanning the horizon, his hands adjusting the straps of packs or checking the condition of wheels and axles. His caravan—or what's left of it—sits at the edge of the encampment, wagons covered in canvas, horses nervous and skittish. He's been a trader, a messenger, a traveler all his life, and the road is the only home he's ever really known.

But the roads aren't safe anymore. His last journey nearly killed him, and he's been stuck in the Rogue Encampment for weeks now, waiting for a moment when it might be safe to travel again. He tells stories about the places he's been—Lut Gholein in the east, the desert cities, the trade routes that crisscross Sanctuary. But there's a weariness in his voice, the knowledge that those places might not exist anymore, that the world has changed in ways that make an old traveler obsolete.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Initial Meeting:**

**Warriv:** *"Welcome to my camp, such as it is."* He gestures to the wagons with a weary smile. *"I'm Warriv. I used to run trade routes between here and the East. Used to be profitable work. Now..."* He shrugs. *"Now I'm stuck here, waiting for the roads to be safe again. If they ever will be."*

*"I was heading to Lut Gholein when the troubles started. Got as far as the Tamoe Highland before I had to turn back. The things out there... they're not natural. And they're getting worse."*

*"I know the routes, though. I know the way East, and when the time comes—when you've done what needs doing here—I can get you there, but that's a long way off yet. For now, we're all stuck here together."*

**Information About the East:**

**Warriv:** *"Lut Gholein is... was... a city unlike any other. Built on the edge of the desert, all white stone and minarets. The markets there, you could find anything. Spices from Caldeum, silks from Kurast, weapons from the barbarian lands."*

*"But it's been a while since I've been there. Weeks now. And who knows what's happened in that time? The corruption, the darkness—it seems to be spreading. Maybe Lut Gholein is still standing. Maybe it's fallen like Tristram. I don't know."*

*"But if you want to get there, I can take you. Once you've dealt with Andariel, once the way is clear, my wagons will be ready. The journey isn't safe, but it's possible. And sometimes that's enough."*

**Sisters' Fate Dialogue:**

**Warriv:** *"The Rogues... it's a tragedy, what happened to them. They were good people, proud. The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye had been around for generations. Their monastery was supposed to be impregnable."*

He shakes his head. *"I've traded with them for years. Brought them supplies, carried messages, shared news from the East. They were always welcoming, always fair. And now..."*

*"Now most of them are dead, or worse—turned against everything they stood for. Andariel did that. The Maiden of Anguish. She corrupted them from within, twisted their purpose. The ones who escaped, like Kashya and Charsi, they're the lucky ones. The rest are just... gone."*

**After Andariel's Defeat (Quest 6):**

**Warriv:** *"You did it. You actually did it. Andariel is dead, and the way East is open."* He moves with new energy, checking his wagons, adjusting harnesses. *"My caravan is ready. The horses are rested, the wagons are loaded. If you want to go to Lut Gholein, I can take you there."*

*"The journey will take days, maybe a week. We'll need to cross the Tamoe Highland, then through the pass to the desert. It won't be safe—nothing is, these days—but it's the only way East."*

*"When you're ready, just say the word. I've been waiting long enough. It's time to get moving again."*

___
- Transportation to Act II (after Quest 6)

## Deckard Cain

{{wide
##### The Last Horadrim

**Deckard Cain** is an old man who carries the weight of centuries. He wears the robes of the Horadrim, ancient and weathered, marked with symbols that speak of knowledge long forgotten by most of the world. His staff is both weapon and symbol, carved with runes that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. His eyes are old, but they're sharp—they see things others miss, and they understand things that others can't.

Cain is the last of the Horadrim, an order that was founded to battle the Prime Evils. He's spent his life studying the darkness, learning its ways, preparing for battles that most people never knew were coming. He's seen Sanctuary fall to corruption before, and he knows what's coming now. The knowledge is a burden, but it's also a weapon.

After his rescue from Tristram, Cain establishes himself in the encampment. He sets up a small tent near Akara's, a place where he can study, think, and offer his services to those fighting the darkness.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
**Rescue Dialogue (Quest 3 - In Tristram):**

**Cain:** *"You... you came. I didn't think anyone would come."* His voice is hoarse, strained from captivity. He's been locked in an iron gibbet beside Tristram's ruined well, surrounded by the undead, but his spirit hasn't been broken. *"I am Deckard Cain, last of the Horadrim. I've been here for... for too long. The undead keep coming, but they haven't killed me. They seem to be waiting for something."*

*"You must get me out of here. There are things I need to tell you, things you need to know. The Prime Evils are returning, and if we don't act soon, it will be too late. Please, get me out of this place."*

**After Rescue (Returning to Encampment):**

**Cain:** *"Thank you. I owe you my life, and more than that—I owe you my knowledge. There are things I must tell you, things you need to understand about what's happening to Sanctuary."*

*"The Prime Evils—Diablo, Mephisto, Baal—they've been defeated before, but they always return. Their influence corrupts everything it touches, and right now, Andariel serves as their agent here in the West. But she's not the only threat. The darkness is spreading, and we must be prepared."*

**Item Identification Service:**

**Cain:** *"You've found something interesting, I see. The magical items in this world often hold properties that aren't immediately apparent. Let me examine it..."* He takes the item, turning it over in his hands, muttering ancient words.

*"I can identify any magical item you find. The process isn't difficult, for one with the right knowledge. Just bring me what you need identified, and I'll tell you what it truly is."*

**Lore Exposition (Prime Evils):**

**Cain:** *"You need to understand what you're facing. The Prime Evils—Diablo, Lord of Terror; Mephisto, Lord of Hatred; and Baal, Lord of Destruction—they are more than demons. They are fundamental forces of darkness, manifestations of the worst aspects of existence."*

*"When they were last defeated, the Horadrim bound them in Soulstones and buried them deep. But Soulstones can be corrupted, and the Prime Evils can influence events even from within them. That's what happened in Tristram. That's what's happening now."*

**Lore Exposition (Andariel):**

**Cain:** *"Andariel is called the Maiden of Anguish, and the name fits. She corrupts by breaking the spirit, by showing her victims everything they've lost, everything they can never have again. She didn't just kill the Rogues at the Monastery—she broke them, turned them into mockeries of what they were."*

*"But even she serves a greater purpose. She's preparing the way, weakening Sanctuary, making it ready for the return of her masters. If she isn't stopped, the Prime Evils will have an even stronger foothold when they return."*

##### Akara's Request

As the heroes arrive at the Rogue Encampment, their presence draws immediate attention. The encampment feels more like a field hospital than a town—wounded warriors sit around smoldering campfires, their eyes hollow with exhaustion and loss. Among them stands a figure who moves with purpose despite the weight of her responsibilities.

**Akara**, the encampment's priestess and healer, approaches the newcomers with a mixture of hope and desperation in her weathered features. She wears simple robes of undyed cloth, marked with the symbols of her faith—a faith that has been sorely tested. Her hands show the calluses of someone who has worked as much as she has prayed, and her eyes carry the weight of one who has seen too much death.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Meeting Akara

When players first speak with Akara in the Rogue Encampment, she addresses them with the cautious hope of someone who has learned not to trust easily:

**Akara:** *"There is a place of great evil in the wilderness."* Her voice is grave, her expression troubled. *"Kashya's Rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave. I fear that these creatures are massing for an attack against our encampment. If you are sincere about helping us, find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts. May the Great Eye watch over you."*

If players ask for more information about the cave:

**Akara:** *"I should add that many Rogue scouts have died in that horrible place. We cannot afford to lose any more. If you choose to enter that Den of Evil, you must do so alone."* She pauses, her expression grave. *"The Den of Evil is located in the Blood Moor, just outside our encampment. The cave is noticeably dark and is home to Fallen, Fallen Shaman, Zombies, and Gargantuan Beasts. Be wary of the shamans—they can resurrect their Fallen companions, so you must strike them down first."*

**Other NPCs' Comments (After Initiating Quest):**

**Charsi:** *"The beasts from the cave have begun to roam throughout the countryside. You'd better be careful out there."*

**Gheed:** *"You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust my sacred scepter into the foulest, carbuncular trull than set one boot into that cave."*

**Kashya:** *"The demons in that cave have claimed many of my finest archers. I wonder how you will fare!"*

**Warriv:** *"One who seeks that cave, seeks death."*

**Kashya (Early Return - If Players Return Before Completing):** *"You'd better come through on this. Your reputation depends on it."*
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Quest Objectives

**Quest Giver:** Akara (Rogue Encampment)

**Location:** Blood Moor → Den of Evil

##### The Den of Evil - Encounter Details

The entrance to the Den of Evil is unmistakable. A jagged opening in the earth exhales cold, foul air that smells of rot and wrongness. Crude symbols have been scratched into the stone around the entrance—rough marks that might be Infernal script or simply the work of mindless claws. Just beyond the entrance, darkness swallows the light, and from within comes the sound of chittering and scraping.

**Enemies Found in the Den:**

The Den of Evil is home to:
- **Fallen** (the primary threat)
- **Fallen Shaman** (can resurrect Fallen companions—priority target)
- **Zombies** (undead horrors)
- **Gargantuan Beasts** (if using these creatures—see page XX for stats)

**Strategy Note:** At this early stage of the adventure, the party should be cautious and well-prepared. The Fallen Shamans are particularly dangerous, as they can resurrect their Fallen companions. Parties should prioritize eliminating the shamans before engaging their minions, lest the fallen enemies rise again to fight once more.

**Initial Encounter (Entrance):**
- **2-3 Fallen** lurk just inside the entrance, using the darkness for cover
- They flee deeper into the cave if one is killed (introducing pack behavior)
- **DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)** check to notice them before they notice the party

**Main Chamber (First Room):**
- **4-5 Fallen** with **1 Fallen Shaman**
- The shaman stays near the back, using Fire Bolt while the Fallen engage in melee
- If any Fallen are killed, the shaman attempts to use Shamanic Revivification
- **Tactical Note:** Players must learn to prioritize the shaman first, or they will never finish the task

**Secondary Tunnel (Connecting Passage):**
- **2-3 Fallen** patrol this area
- Narrow passage (5 feet wide) forces single-file movement
- Opportunity to teach about positioning and bottleneck tactics

**Deep Chamber (Final Room):**
- **3-4 Fallen** with **1 Fallen Shaman** and **1-2 Zombies**
- This is the largest concentration of enemies, making target prioritization crucial
- **Corpsefire:** A powerful undead horror known as **Corpsefire** guards the deepest reaches of the Den, usually located at the end opposite the entrance (see stat block below). If the Game Master includes Corpsefire, he replaces or supplements the standard encounter here.
- **Hidden Cache:** A careful search (DC 15 Investigation check) reveals a small cache hidden behind loose stones or within a crevice. It contains minor loot: 2d6 gold pieces, 1d4 potions of healing, and possibly a minor magic item (25% chance)

**Tracking Progress:**

The Game Master should track the total number of enemies within the Den and inform the party of their progress as they clear each section. This helps players understand their advancement and creates a sense of accomplishment as they systematically eliminate the threat (e.g., "As the last Fallen in the main chamber falls, the sounds from deeper in the cave grow quieter—you've cleared this section, but there are still more creatures ahead").

**Environmental Features:**
- **Darkness:** Most of the cave is unlit (dim light near entrance, darkness beyond)
- **Uneven Ground:** Difficult terrain in places (stale water, rubble)
- **Echoing:** Sounds carry, alerting distant enemies (stealth is difficult)
- **Cold:** The unnatural chill saps morale (no mechanical effect, but atmospheric)

{{descriptive,wide
##### Corpsefire Encounter Details

Corpsefire waits in the deepest chamber of the Den of Evil, a room where the corruption is strongest. Blue necrotic flames flicker around his decaying form, casting an eerie light that makes the shadows dance. He stands surrounded by the remains of previous adventurers, their bones scattered across the chamber floor—testaments to his power.

As the party enters, read or paraphrase:

*The chamber opens before you, wider and deeper than the tunnels leading here. In the center, a figure wreathed in blue flame stands waiting. It's a zombie, but something more—its flesh glows with unholy fire, and its eyes burn with cold intelligence. Around it, bones litter the floor, evidence of those who came before. This is Corpsefire, and it has been waiting.*

**Initial Setup:**

- **Corpsefire** stands in the center of the chamber
- **2d3 Zombies** positioned around him (from his previous victims)
- **1d3 Fallen** cowering at the edges (they fear Corpsefire's power)
- Chamber is 40x40 feet with natural pillars providing half cover

**Combat Phases:**
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Corpsefire Combat Tactics

**Phase 1: Aura of Death (Full HP to 30 HP)**

Corpsefire begins the fight as a tank, using his aura and positioning to control the battlefield:
- Moves to engage melee combatants, forcing them into his 5-foot aura
- Uses Deathly Charge to knock down ranged attackers or spellcasters
- Focuses on one target at a time with Multiattack
- Zombies and Fallen act as distractions and additional threats
- Tactical Note: Players should learn to avoid melee range or accept the aura damage

**Phase 2: Relentless Assault (30 HP to 10 HP)**

As Corpsefire takes damage, he becomes more aggressive:
- Charges more frequently, using Deathly Charge as soon as it recharges
- Targets weakened party members, attempting to finish them off
- His Relentless Dead trait may trigger, allowing him to survive what should be killing blows
- Zombies prioritize protecting Corpsefire, blocking paths to him
- Fallen flee if Corpsefire seems to be losing (they're cowardly)

**Phase 3: Final Stand (10 HP and below)**

At low health, Corpsefire becomes desperate:
- Uses Deathly Charge every turn if available
- Focuses all attacks on the weakest-looking party member
- Relentless Dead becomes more likely to trigger (lower damage = easier save)
- May attempt to retreat to a narrow passage, forcing single-file pursuit
- Will not surrender or flee—it fights until destroyed

**Key Tactical Considerations:**

- **Aura Damage:** The necrotic aura makes melee combat dangerous—players should coordinate positioning or accept the damage
- **Relentless Dead:** Radiant damage and critical hits bypass this—encourage players to use these if available
- **Deathly Charge:** Knocks targets prone, setting them up for follow-up attacks—players should spread out
- **Frost-Touched:** Reduced speed makes retreat difficult—players should plan escape routes
- **Minions:** Zombies and Fallen should be dealt with quickly to prevent Corpsefire from overwhelming the party

**Environmental Features:**

- **Natural Pillars:** Provide half cover (+2 AC) from ranged attacks
- **Narrow Passage (Exit):** Only 5 feet wide—can be used as a choke point
- **Uneven Floor:** Some areas are difficult terrain (piles of bones, rubble)
- **Shallow Pools:** Stagnant water can extinguish fires but offers no tactical advantage

##### Completion and Reward

When the last creature falls, an almost physical weight lifts from the cave. The oppressive feeling of wrongness begins to fade, and for the first time since entering, the darkness feels like simple absence of light rather than something malevolent and alive. **The Den is flooded with light**—a warm, golden radiance that drives away every shadow and banishes the corruption from the cave. The transformation is immediate and complete.

The return journey to the Rogue Encampment feels lighter as well. The Blood Moor still holds danger, but there is a sense of progress, of having struck the first blow against the darkness.

**Returning to Akara:**

**Akara:** *"You have cleansed the Den of Evil. You've earned my trust and may yet restore my faith in humanity."* She reaches out and places a hand on each party member's shoulder in turn, her touch warm and comforting. A subtle glow emanates from her palm, and each adventurer feels a surge of inner strength—a blessing that enhances their natural capabilities.

*"This blessing I grant you represents the Light's favor. Your body, mind, or spirit will grow stronger from this victory. Use this gift well, for you will need every advantage in the days ahead."*

**Reward:** Each player gains +1 to one ability score of their choice (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), plus 100 XP. This blessing from Akara represents the party's first significant victory and the experience gained from facing the dangers within. The ability score increase takes effect immediately and represents the growth that comes from surviving one's first real test against the darkness.

**Other NPCs (Upon Completion):**

**Charsi:** *"You are truly brave and skillful... Akara was worried about you."*

**Gheed:** *"The only good demon is a dead one, I say. By the way, did you happen to find anything in that cave you'd like to sell?"*

**Kashya:** *"Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may reward you."*

**Warriv:** *"...That which does not kill you makes you stronger."*

**Akara (Post-Quest):** *"The Den is clear, but this is only the beginning. The darkness has spread far beyond that single cave. The encampment is safe for now, but we cannot rest."*

*"For now, rest here if you wish. I can provide healing, and I have a few potions and supplies for those who need them. You are welcome in our encampment, heroes. You have earned that much, at least."*

She pauses, her expression thoughtful. *"When you are ready to continue, speak with Kashya. She has another matter that needs attention—something that cannot wait much longer. The victory you've achieved here has proven your worth, and she may be willing to trust you with a more difficult task."*

**Note:** After completing this quest, Kashya will approach the party or be willing to speak with them about the next quest: Sisters' Burial Grounds (Blood Raven).

##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Easy (Introduction)

**Recommended Party Level:** 1

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours of play time

**Encounter Balancing:**
- Adjust enemy numbers based on party size (add 1 enemy per party member beyond 4)
- For smaller parties (2-3), reduce enemy count by 1-2
- If players struggle, have Akara provide a healing potion before they leave

**Teaching Moments:**
- **Pack Tactics:** Fallen work together, demonstrating the importance of focusing attacks rather than spreading damage
- **Priority Targets:** The Shaman's ability to revive allies teaches the importance of eliminating support units first
- **Darkness and Light:** The Den's oppressive darkness teaches players to manage light sources and understand how different creatures interact with darkness
- **Resource Management:** Limited spell slots and hit points encourage players to think strategically about when to use their abilities

**If Players Refuse the Quest:**
- Akara understands but is clearly disappointed, and the encampment remains in a state of unease
- No ability score bonus or quest XP is granted; the Den of Evil remains a threat
- The quest can be accepted later if the party changes their mind, though the sense of urgency may be diminished
- If players continue to refuse, consider having Kashya or another NPC approach them with a more direct appeal, or allow the threat to manifest in a way that makes the quest unavoidable

**Additional Encounters (Optional):**

While traveling between the Rogue Encampment and the Den of Evil, the party might encounter:

- **Random Wanderers:** 1d3 Zombies shambling across the Blood Moor (25% chance while traveling to the Den)
- **Fallen Patrol:** A small warband of 2-3 Fallen scouting the area between the encampment and the Den
- **Wildlife:** Spike Fiends or other corrupted creatures (if you want to introduce these enemy types early)

**Loot Suggestions:**
- Standard loot from defeated enemies: 3d10 gold pieces total, 1d4 potions of healing scattered among the fallen creatures
- Hidden cache in Deep Chamber (see encounter details)
- Small chance (10%) for a minor magic item to be found among the remains: a +1 weapon, a minor charm, or a simple magic item appropriate for 1st-level characters

**Corpsefire Encounter:**
If the Game Master includes Corpsefire as the guardian of the Deep Chamber:
- **Additional Loot:** 5d10 gold pieces from Corpsefire's remains, 1d4 potions of healing, and 1 gem (roll on the gem table if using gems)
- **Unique Loot:** 25% chance for a rare magic item (weapon or armor with necrotic or cold resistance, or another appropriate minor magic item)
- **Experience Bonus:** +100 XP for defeating Corpsefire (in addition to his normal XP value)
- **Tactical Note:** This is a more challenging encounter than the standard Den creatures—Corpsefire serves as an introduction to boss-style encounters with unique abilities and multiple phases

**Atmospheric Elements:**
- Play up the contrast between the (relatively) safe encampment and the dangerous wilds
- Emphasize the unnatural nature of the corruption
- Use the completion to build momentum for future quests

**Transition to Quest 2:**
- After completing this quest, players should feel accomplished but aware that bigger challenges await
- Completing this quest prompts Kashya to activate the next quest (Sisters' Burial Grounds)
- Players should speak with Kashya to receive Quest 2
- Encourage players to explore the encampment and talk to other NPCs
- The quest completion establishes trust with the Rogues and proves the party's worth

# Quest 2: Sisters' Burial Grounds

:::::::
*This quest introduces players to boss encounters, area exploration, and the emotional weight of facing a fallen hero. The journey through the Cold Plains provides additional encounters and opportunities for discovery.*{color:#C9AD6A}

##### Kashya's Request

After clearing the Den of Evil, Akara directs the heroes to speak with Kashya. The Rogue Captain stands at the encampment's eastern edge, her gaze fixed on the horizon where the Cold Plains stretch out into darkness. When approached, she turns slowly, her eyes hard with the weight of what she's about to ask.

**Kashya** speaks with the directness of a soldier who doesn't have time for pleasantries. Her words carry the burden of command, the responsibility of sending people to their possible deaths. But beneath the hardness, there's pain—pain at what has been lost, pain at what must be done.
}}


{{descriptive,wide
##### Meeting Kashya

When players speak with Kashya after completing Quest 1, she addresses them with urgency:

**Kashya:** *"My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the Monastery graveyard!"* Her voice is sharp, urgent, the voice of someone reporting an immediate threat. *"Apparently, Andariel is not content to take only our living. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains in the battle against Diablo at Tristram, was also one of the first to be corrupted by Andariel. Now, you'll find her in the Monastery graveyard raising our dead as zombies! We cannot abide this defilement! If you are truly our ally, you will help us destroy her."*

If players ask for more information about Blood Raven:

**Kashya:** *"Death has done nothing to weaken Blood Raven's combat skills. If anything, she's more deadly than ever."* She pauses, her expression grim. *"The Burial Grounds are located just off the Cold Plains, northeast of here. Blood Raven will be there, within the cemetery gates, surrounded by her army of the undead. She continues to raise the dead as the battle progresses, so she must be your top priority."*

**Other NPCs' Comments (After Initiating Quest):**

**Akara:** *"Blood Raven fought valiantly against Diablo in the catacombs beneath Tristram... She was never quite the same afterwards. It is now obvious she brought an evil influence back with her."*

**Charsi:** *"Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue band that once fought Diablo at Tristram."*

**Gheed:** *"I'm sorry... The undead are bad for trade. I have a strict no-return policy."*

**Warriv:** *"Hmmm... How can one kill what is already dead?"*

**Kashya (Early Return Before Completion):** *"Each moment you delay adds another undead Sister to Blood Raven's army."*

##### Quest Objectives

**Quest Giver:** Kashya (Rogue Encampment)

**Location:** Cold Plains → Burial Grounds

**Objective:** Travel to the Burial Grounds and slay Blood Raven, a corrupted Rogue who is raising the dead as Zombies.

**Completion Requirements:**
- Travel through the Cold Plains to reach the Burial Grounds
- Locate Blood Raven within the cemetery gates (the inner area of the Burial Grounds)
- Defeat Blood Raven—when she falls, her death releases a burst of dark energy that severs the bonds of unlife, causing all remaining undead in the cemetery itself to collapse (though those outside the perimeter of the burial grounds, if any remain, are unaffected)
- Return to Kashya to report success

**Reward:** Free Rogue Archer mercenary (if the party doesn't already have a hireling), plus access to hire further mercenaries from Kashya at any time. Each player also receives 150 XP. This reward represents Kashya's gratitude and the party's growing reputation among the Rogues.

**Recommended Level:** 2-3

##### The Journey to the Burial Grounds

The path to the Burial Grounds leads through the **Cold Plains**, a frozen wasteland where the unnatural chill saps strength and hope alike. The journey itself is dangerous—monsters roam the plains, and the cold makes every step a struggle. See page XX for the Cold Plains encounter table and area description.

The Burial Grounds lie in the northeastern reaches of the Cold Plains, marked by broken headstones and disturbed earth. As the party approaches, they'll notice the air growing colder, the smell of decay growing stronger. The ground itself seems to reject the living, and the silence is broken by the sound of earth shifting, of things moving beneath the surface.

**Strategy Note:** It is advisable for the party to eliminate all the skeletons and hungry dead (Zombies) found at the outer edges of the Burial Grounds—outside the cemetery gates—before engaging Blood Raven. Clearing these outer threats first ensures there will be fewer creatures trying to surround and attack the party during the main confrontation with Blood Raven within the cemetery gates.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Burial Grounds Encounter

As the party enters the Burial Grounds proper, read or paraphrase the following:

*The Burial Grounds stretch before you, a place where the boundary between life and death has been torn asunder. Headstones lie broken and scattered, their inscriptions worn away by time and malice. The ground is uneven, marked by fresh disturbances—graves opened from within. Ahead, you can see the cemetery gates—wrought iron, rusted and broken, hanging askew. Beyond the gates, shuffling forms move with unnatural purpose. In the distance, within the cemetery itself, you can see a figure standing at the center, surrounded by a larger army of undead. The figure turns, and even from this distance, you can see her eyes burn with unholy fire. Blood Raven has noticed you.*

**Initial Encounters (Outside Cemetery Gates):**

Before reaching Blood Raven, the party should deal with the undead patrolling the outer edges:

**Outer Ring (Outside the Cemetery Gates):**
- **2d4 Skeletons** and **2d3 Zombies** (Hungry Dead) patrol the outer edges
- These are recently raised, slower and less coordinated
- **DC 12 Stealth** to bypass them (otherwise they alert Blood Raven)
- **Strategy:** Clearing these first reduces the number of enemies that will try to surround the party during the main fight

**Within the Cemetery Gates (Boss Arena):**

Blood Raven can be found within the cemetery gates, surrounded by her army:
- **Blood Raven** stands at the center
- **2d4 Zombies** surround her, creating a protective barrier
- **1d3 Skeletons** positioned at the edges, using ranged attacks
- Blood Raven will continue to raise the dead as the battle progresses, so she must be the top priority

**Optional Areas:**

The Burial Grounds also contain a **Crypt** and a **Mausoleum**—dangerous but rewarding areas for adventurers seeking greater challenges and treasures. These can be explored after defeating Blood Raven, though they present their own dangers and should not be undertaken lightly.

##### Combat Tactics & Phases

**Phase 1: Ranged Dominance (Full HP to 50 HP)**

Blood Raven begins the fight by staying at range, using her superior mobility and archery skills:
- Moves around quite fast while shooting arrows and flame arrows
- **Cold damage is useful here**—weapons that deal cold damage or items that grant cold-based effects will help slow her movement
- Stays 60-100 feet from the party if possible
- Uses cover (headstones, monuments) to break line of sight
- Focuses fire on spellcasters and ranged attackers first
- Uses Necromantic Command to have zombies engage melee fighters
- Uses Volley when multiple targets are clustered
- Continues to raise the dead as the battle progresses (use Summon Undead and Raise the Fallen abilities)

**Phase 2: Desperate Measures (50 HP to 25 HP)**

As Blood Raven takes damage, she becomes more aggressive:
- Moves closer (30-60 feet) to ensure hits
- Uses Summon Undead to replace fallen minions
- Raises fallen party members or NPCs as zombies if possible
- Uses legendary actions more frequently to maintain pressure
- May attempt to flee if reduced below 25 HP (see below)

**Phase 3: Final Stand (25 HP and below)**

At low health, Blood Raven becomes reckless:
- Engages in melee if cornered (improvised weapon: +8 to hit, 1d4 + 1 damage)
- Uses all legendary actions aggressively
- Focuses on killing individual party members to raise them
- Will not surrender or flee once combat is truly joined

**Fleeing Behavior:**

If Blood Raven drops below 25 HP and has a clear escape route, she attempts to flee using her legendary Move actions and dashes. She heads toward the Mausoleum or Crypt, where she might find reinforcements. If she escapes, the corruption continues, and the party may encounter her again later (possibly stronger, or in a different location).

**Environmental Hazards:**

- **Uneven Ground:** Some areas are difficult terrain (open graves, churned earth)
- **Broken Headstones:** Provide half cover (+2 AC) but can be destroyed
- **Grave Pits:** Deep enough to trap creatures (DC 12 Dexterity to avoid falling in)
- **Concealment:** Mausoleum and monuments provide full cover from ranged attacks

##### Completion and Reward

When Blood Raven falls, the effect is immediate and dramatic. The unholy fire in her eyes fades, replaced for a brief moment by recognition—the woman she once was seeing what she's become. She reaches out toward nothing, whispers a name (perhaps Kashya's, perhaps another Rogue's), and then she's gone. As her form dissolves, a burst of dark energy erupts from where she fell, a wave of power that severs the bonds of unlife. **All remaining undead monsters in the cemetery itself collapse instantly**, their animated forms returning to true death (though those outside the perimeter of the burial grounds, if any remain, are unaffected, as the magic's reach extends only so far). The unnatural silence of the Burial Grounds begins to lift, replaced by the normal sounds of wind and earth.

The return to the Rogue Encampment is somber. Word has spread of the mission, and the remaining Rogues watch with a mixture of hope and grief. They know what had to be done, but that doesn't make it easier.

**Returning to Kashya:**

**Kashya:** *"I cannot believe you have accomplished what my Rogues could not. Blood Raven's torment has finally ended...and I thank you for releasing her from damnation. She fought valiantly against Diablo, but the evil she was exposed to was far too powerful. Your heroism has given me hope...and I would like to offer you something to aid in your struggle. One of my finest warriors has volunteered to join you. She will fight at your side...and obey your commands."*

She gestures to a group of Rogues nearby, all of them watching with solemn respect. *"If you don't already have a hireling, I'll give you one of my scouts for free. They're good fighters—better archers than most, and they know how to move in the wilderness. They won't replace a party member, but they'll keep you from dying to an arrow in the back, or catch something you might have missed. And from now on, you can hire further mercenaries from me at any time, should you need to replace one or hire additional help."*

**Reward:** Each player receives 150 XP. If the party doesn't already have a hireling, they receive a **free Rogue Archer mercenary** (see page XX for stats). In addition, the party gains access to hire further mercenaries from Kashya at any time (for a fee, if replacing an existing mercenary). This reward represents Kashya's gratitude for freeing Blood Raven from her torment and the party's proven worth to the Rogue Encampment.

**Other NPCs (Upon Completion):**

**Akara:** *"Andariel must be made to pay for her sacrilege!"*

**Charsi:** *"Kashya wishes to reward you for your defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, too, even though Blood Raven was once my friend."*

**Gheed:** *"Some of those gals weren't so nice the first time around."*

**Warriv:** *"Hmm... Perhaps there is hope after all."*

**Kashya (Post-Quest):** *"Blood Raven is at peace now. That's something, at least. But there are others still out there—sisters who were corrupted, turned into monsters. And Andariel still rules from the Monastery. This is far from over."*

*"But you've proven yourselves. When you're ready for the next challenge, speak with Akara—she has another mission that needs doing."*

**Note:** Completion of this quest prompts Akara to give the next Act I quest, The Search for Cain.

##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Medium

**Recommended Party Level:** 2-3

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours of play time

**Encounter Balancing:**
- Adjust Blood Raven's minion count based on party size (add 1-2 zombies per party member beyond 4)
- For smaller parties (2-3), reduce Blood Raven's legendary actions to 1 instead of 2
- If players struggle, have undead fight less efficiently, or allow Kashya to provide healing supplies beforehand
- Consider giving Blood Raven disadvantage if players use tactics that exploit her corruption (holy water, radiant damage, etc.)

**Teaching Moments:**
- **Boss Mechanics:** Blood Raven uses legendary actions, introducing players to multi-phase combat encounters
- **Minion Management:** Players should learn to deal with minions while managing the boss—clear outer enemies first, then focus on the boss to avoid being overwhelmed
- **Environmental Awareness:** The Burial Grounds offer cover, difficult terrain, and positioning opportunities—encourage players to use the environment tactically
- **Resource Management:** This is a longer encounter than Quest 1; players must manage spell slots, hit points, and abilities more carefully
- **Elemental Strategy:** Cold damage is useful to slow Blood Raven down—introduces the concept of using specific damage types against certain enemies and adapting tactics based on enemy weaknesses

**Roleplay Opportunities:**
- Blood Raven might have brief moments of clarity before death
- Players might try to save or redeem her (it's impossible, but let them try)
- Kashya's grief should be palpable—this is someone she knew and respected
- Other Rogues in the encampment react to the news with mixed emotions

**Loot Suggestions:**
- Blood Raven's bow (Blood Raven's Charge—see page XX for full stats), found clutched in her hand or lying nearby
- 5d10 gold pieces from her remains
- 1d4 potions of healing
- Rare magic item (30% chance) found among her personal effects
- Gem or rune (20% chance) discovered in a pouch or container
- Items from fallen undead: 2d10 gold pieces total, 1d2 potions of healing scattered among the remains

**Atmospheric Elements:**
- Play up the tragedy of facing a fallen hero
- Emphasize the corruption—show how Blood Raven is trapped between what she was and what she's become
- Use the Burial Grounds setting to create an oppressive, mournful atmosphere
- Let the silence after victory feel heavy—they won, but at what cost?

**Transition to Quest 3:**
- After completing this quest, players should have a mercenary companion if they didn't already have one
- The next major quest (The Search for Cain) can be mentioned by multiple NPCs, particularly Akara, who will approach the party with news of Deckard Cain's predicament
- Encourage exploration of the Cold Plains and optional areas (Crypt and Mausoleum) for additional encounters and rewards
- Players should have gained sufficient experience from this quest to be ready for more challenging content ahead

# Quest 3: The Search for Cain

:::::::
*This quest expands the scope of the adventure, introducing long-distance travel, portal magic, and the tragic history of Tristram. The journey through multiple areas provides opportunities for exploration and side encounters, while the rescue of Deckard Cain unlocks crucial services and lore.*{color:#C9AD6A}

##### Akara's Request

After the party returns from defeating Blood Raven, Akara approaches them with a mixture of hope and desperation. The priestess has been thinking deeply about their situation, and she realizes that there is someone who might be able to help—someone with knowledge they desperately need.

**Akara** speaks with the measured wisdom of someone who has seen too much and understands the scope of what they face. Her eyes carry the weight of responsibility, and when she mentions Deckard Cain, there's both hope and fear in her voice—hope that he might still be alive, fear that he might already be lost to the darkness.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Meeting Akara

When players speak with Akara after completing Quest 2, she addresses them with urgency:

**Akara:** *"It is clear that we are facing an Evil difficult to comprehend, let alone combat."* She clasps her hands together, her expression grave. *"There is only one Horadrim sage, schooled in the most arcane history and lore, who could advise us... His name is Deckard Cain. You must go to Tristram and find him, my friend. I pray that he still lives."*

If players ask how to get to Tristram:

**Akara:** *"Tristram is too far to journey by foot... Cain would likely be dead when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly. To open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss."*

*"You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss and bring back its bark—or rather, a scroll carved from its bark. I will translate the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic pattern."*

**Akara continues:** *"The Tree of Inifuss is located in the Dark Wood, which in turn is accessible only through the Underground Passage in the Stony Field. The tree is guarded by a powerful creature—Treehead Woodfist, they call him. A corrupted skeleton of immense strength. You'll need to defeat him to obtain the scroll."*

*"Once you have the scroll, bring it to me. I can read the ancient runes and tell you the order in which to touch the Cairn Stones. Without that order, the portal cannot be opened."*

**Other NPCs' Comments:**

**Charsi:** *"If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, Akara will tell you how to get to Tristram."*

**Gheed:** *"I would sooner micturate in a tankard of my own ale than journey to Tristram!"*

**Kashya:** *"The bark of Inifuss holds mystical runes. Akara can translate them... into our revenge!"*

**Warriv:** *"Months ago, I came across a few survivors from Tristram. They said that Cain had gone half-mad and could no longer distinguish fact from fantasy."*

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Journey to Dark Wood

The path to the Dark Wood begins in the **Stony Field**, a desolate landscape of broken rock and twisted earth. The journey itself is dangerous—monsters roam freely, and the terrain is treacherous. See page XX for the Stony Field encounter table and area description.

From the Stony Field, the party must find the entrance to the **Underground Passage**, a network of tunnels that connects different areas. The passage is dark, claustrophobic, and filled with dangers. See page XX for the Underground Passage area description.

The Underground Passage leads to the **Dark Wood**, a forest corrupted by demonic influence. The trees are twisted into unnatural shapes, and the canopy blocks out almost all light. The air is heavy with the smell of decay and corruption. See page XX for the Dark Wood area description.

**Finding the Tree of Inifuss:**

The Tree of Inifuss stands in the heart of the Dark Wood, a massive, gnarled tree that seems to pulse with dark energy. Its bark is black and twisted, and its branches reach out like claws. At its base, a figure stands guard—Treehead Woodfist, a corrupted skeleton warrior of immense power.

The tree itself is marked with ancient symbols, and a scroll is embedded in its trunk, protected by dark magic. The scroll can only be removed by defeating Treehead Woodfist, who has been bound to protect it.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Tree of Inifuss Encounter

As the party approaches the Tree of Inifuss, read or paraphrase the following:

*The Tree of Inifuss looms before you, a monument to corruption and despair. It stands alone in a clearing, its branches reaching toward a sky it can no longer see. The ground around it is bare and blackened, as if nothing can grow in its shadow. At the base of the tree, a figure stands motionless—a skeleton, but larger than any you've seen before. Its bones are blackened and fused together in places, and it holds a massive weapon that seems to be made of the same twisted wood as the tree itself. As you approach, the skeleton's head turns, empty eye sockets fixing on you with malevolent intent. Treehead Woodfist has noticed you.*

**Initial Encounter:**

Before reaching Treehead Woodfist, the party must deal with his minions:
- **2d4 Skeletons** patrol the area around the tree
- **1d3 Zombies** shamble through the undergrowth
- These minions are more organized than usual, moving in formation

**The Boss Arena:**

Treehead Woodfist stands at the base of the Tree of Inifuss, surrounded by his undead minions:
- **Treehead Woodfist** (see stat block below)
- **1d4 Skeletons** positioned around the tree
- **1d3 Zombies** emerging from the ground

##### Combat Tactics & Phases

**Phase 1: Defensive Stance (Full HP to 60 HP)**

Treehead Woodfist begins the fight by staying near the Tree of Inifuss:
- Remains within 30 feet of the tree to benefit from Treebound
- Uses minions to engage melee fighters while he focuses on spellcasters
- Uses Summon Undead to replace fallen minions
- Uses Ground Slam when multiple enemies are clustered

**Phase 2: Aggressive Assault (60 HP to 30 HP)**

As Treehead Woodfist takes damage, he becomes more aggressive:
- Moves away from the tree to pursue fleeing enemies
- Uses Sweeping Strike more frequently
- Focuses on eliminating individual party members
- Uses legendary actions more aggressively

**Phase 3: Desperate Stand (30 HP and below)**

At low health, Treehead Woodfist becomes reckless:
- Returns to the tree if possible to benefit from Treebound
- Uses all abilities as soon as they become available (recharge abilities used immediately when they recharge)
- Focuses on killing rather than survival
- Will not retreat or surrender

**Obtaining the Scroll:**

Once Treehead Woodfist is defeated, the dark magic protecting the tree fades. A careful search of the Tree of Inifuss (DC 10 Investigation check to find the scroll embedded in the bark, or DC 8 Perception check to notice it) reveals the **Scroll of Inifuss**. The scroll is carved from the tree's bark, marked with ancient runes that seem to shift and writhe when observed directly. The runes are in a language the party cannot read—they need Akara's translation to understand what they mean.

**Returning to Akara:**

The party must return to the Rogue Encampment with the scroll. When they present it to Akara, she examines it carefully.

**Akara:** *"Ah, very good. I have translated the runes on this scroll."* She unrolls the scroll, her fingers tracing the ancient symbols. *"You must find the Cairn Stones and touch them in the order that I have written."* She provides the party with a translated sequence—a specific order in which the stones must be touched. *"The Cairn Stones are located in the Stony Field, somewhere among the broken rocks and twisted earth. They form a circle, ancient and powerful. But be warned—the stones are guarded. Rakanishu, a lightning-infused Fallen Shaman, protects them. You'll need to defeat him before you can access the stones."*
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Cairn Stones and Rakanishu

After obtaining Akara's translation, the party must return to the **Stony Field** and locate the **Cairn Stones**—a circle of ancient standing stones marked with runes similar to those on the scroll. The stones stand in a clearing, arranged in a perfect circle, their surfaces covered in weathered inscriptions.

**Rakanishu's Encounter:**

As the party approaches the Cairn Stones, they'll notice a figure moving among the rocks—a Fallen Shaman larger and more dangerous than any they've encountered before. This is **Rakanishu**, a Super Unique Carver infused with lightning magic. He and his warband guard the stones, preventing anyone from accessing the portal.

**Initial Encounter:**
- **Rakanishu** (see stat block on next page) stands near the center of the stone circle
- **2d4 Fallen** warriors surround him
- **1d2 Fallen Shamans** assist with revival magic
- The warband attacks immediately upon seeing the party

{{descriptive,wide
##### Rakanishu's Combat Tactics

**Phase 1: Warband Leader (Full HP to 40 HP)**

Rakanishu begins the fight by using his warband:
- Stays at range, using Lightning Bolt attacks
- Uses Teleport to maintain distance and avoid melee
- Uses Shamanic Revivification to keep fallen allies in the fight
- Uses Summon Fallen to reinforce his numbers
- Commands Fallen to engage melee fighters

**Phase 2: Lightning Fury (40 HP to 20 HP)**

As Rakanishu takes damage, he becomes more aggressive:
- Moves closer to use Lightning Nova
- Uses Lightning Nova more frequently when enemies cluster
- Teleports to escape dangerous situations
- Focuses on eliminating individual party members
- Uses legendary actions more aggressively

**Phase 3: Desperate Stand (20 HP and below)**

At low health, Rakanishu becomes reckless:
- Uses all abilities as soon as they become available (recharge abilities used immediately when they recharge)
- Teleports frequently to avoid attacks, using his teleportation ability whenever possible
- Uses Lightning Nova even when it might hit his own allies
- Will not retreat or surrender

**Environmental Features:**

- **Cairn Stones:** The standing stones provide half cover (+2 AC) and can be used for tactical positioning
- **Stone Circle:** Difficult terrain around the edges of the circle
- **Lightning Conduits:** If Rakanishu touches the stones, they may crackle with energy (GM can add environmental effects)
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

{{descriptive,wide
##### Opening the Portal:

Once Rakanishu and his warband are defeated, the party can access the Cairn Stones. Using Akara's translation, they must touch each stone in the correct order. The Game Master should provide the sequence based on Akara's instructions. For a more interactive experience, the GM can require players to follow the translated sequence carefully, with incorrect touches causing minor effects (small sparks, a sense of wrongness) before they get it right.

When touched in the correct order, read or paraphrase:

*As your hand touches the final stone in the sequence, the air within the circle begins to shimmer. The runes carved into the stones glow with an unearthly light—blue-white and crackling with energy. The space between the stones warps and twists, and through the distortion, you can see something else—a ruined town, its buildings burned and broken, shrouded in perpetual twilight. The portal to Tristram is open.*

The portal remains open for 1 hour, or until the party returns through it. Once closed, it can be reopened by touching the stones in the correct order again.

**Entering Tristram:**

Stepping through the portal is disorienting. The party emerges in the center of Tristram's ruins, surrounded by the devastation of the fallen town. The portal remains visible behind them, a shimmering gateway back to the Stony Field.

{{descriptive,wide
##### Tristram - The Cursed Town

Tristram is a place of death and memory. The buildings are burned-out shells, the streets littered with debris and bones. The air tastes of ash and regret, and the silence is oppressive. See page XX for the full Tristram area description.

**Initial Encounters:**

As the party explores Tristram, they'll face:
- **2d4 Zombies** wandering the streets
- **1d3 Skeletons** in the ruins
- **1d2 Corrupt Rogues** (if any remain)
- The undead are more numerous and aggressive here than in other areas

**Locating Deckard Cain:**

Deckard Cain can be found near the **well** in the center of Tristram. The well is a stone structure, its bucket long since rotted away, its rope hanging in tattered shreds. Cain is locked in a cage nearby, surrounded by several **Champion monsters** (elite undead with enhanced abilities—treat as Zombies or Skeletons with the Champion template: +2 to AC, double hit points, and one additional damage die).

**Notable Tristram Residents:**

**Griswold** can be found in or near the old church/cathedral. He is Tristram's former blacksmith, now an undead horror. He stands hammering at an anvil that no longer exists, lost in the memory of his former life. The party may encounter him while searching for Cain, but he is not required to be defeated to rescue Cain.

**Wirt** may also be found in Tristram—a corpse merchant who sells rare items for exorbitant prices. He's already dead but still conducts business with dark humor. (The GM can include Wirt as an optional encounter if desired.)

### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces Griswold to 0 hit points, he must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, Griswold drops to 1 hit point instead.  
:
***Memories of the Forge.*** Griswold remembers fragments of his former life. When he reduces a creature to 0 hit points, he can use a bonus action to raise that creature as a **Zombie** at the start of his next turn. The zombie appears in the space where the creature died and is under Griswold's control. He can control up to 6 zombies in this way.  
:
***Master Blacksmith.*** Griswold's hammer attacks ignore resistance to bludgeoning damage and deal double damage to objects and structures.

___
### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Griswold makes two *Warhammer* attacks.  
:
***Warhammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
:
***Thunderous Strike (Recharge 5–6).*** Griswold slams his hammer into the ground, creating a shockwave. Each creature within 15 feet of him must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are also deafened until the end of their next turn.  
:
***Summon Undead (1/Day).*** Griswold raises 2d4 **Zombies** from the ground in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of him. The zombies act immediately after Griswold in the initiative order and are under his control.  
___

Griswold can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Griswold regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Move.*** Griswold moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Strike.*** Griswold makes one Warhammer attack.

***Command Undead.*** Griswold uses his Memories of the Forge trait to raise a fallen creature as a zombie (if available).

##### Griswold's Combat Tactics

**Pre-Fight Monologue:**

Before combat begins, Griswold may have a moment of clarity. The GM can choose to have him speak, his voice a hollow echo of what it once was:

**Griswold (if the GM chooses):** *"I... I remember. The forge. The heat. The sound of hammer on metal. I made weapons. Good weapons. Weapons that could... that could..."* His voice trails off, and the corruption reasserts itself. *"No. No, that's gone. All gone. Just the hammer now. Just the work. The work never ends."*

**Combat Phases:**

**Phase 1: The Craftsman (Full HP to 70 HP)**
- Griswold fights methodically, using his hammer with precision
- Focuses on one target at a time
- Uses Thunderous Strike when enemies cluster
- Raises fallen enemies as zombies to create a protective barrier

**Phase 2: The Corrupted (70 HP to 35 HP)**
- Griswold becomes more aggressive, swinging wildly
- Uses Summon Undead to flood the battlefield
- Moves to engage multiple enemies
- Uses legendary actions more frequently

**Phase 3: The Broken (35 HP and below)**
- Griswold fights with desperate, reckless abandon
- Uses all abilities as soon as they become available (recharge abilities used immediately when they recharge)
- Focuses on killing individual party members
- May have brief moments of clarity before death

**Environmental Features:**

- **The Anvil:** A broken anvil in the center of the room (can be used for cover, +2 AC)
- **Forging Tools:** Scattered tools that can be used as improvised weapons
- **Collapsed Ceiling:** Parts of the ceiling have fallen, creating difficult terrain
- **Church Pews:** Broken pews provide half cover (+2 AC) but can be destroyed
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Rescuing Deckard Cain

The party must fight through the Champion monsters guarding Cain's cage. These are elite undead with enhanced abilities—faster, stronger, and more resilient than their normal counterparts.

**The Rescue:**

The cage can be opened with:
- A DC 15 Strength check to break the lock
- A DC 12 Thieves' Tools check to pick the lock
- Destroying the cage (AC 15, 20 hit points, vulnerable to bludgeoning)

Once freed, Cain is weak but determined. He's been trapped for weeks, possibly months, and the ordeal has taken its toll. He'll need protection to escape Tristram, but he's not helpless—he can use basic spells and his staff as a weapon if necessary.

**Cain's Dialogue (In Tristram):**

See page XX for Deckard Cain's full dialogue. When first rescued, he expresses gratitude and urgency:

**Cain:** *"You... you came. I didn't think anyone would come."* His voice is hoarse, strained from captivity. *"I am Deckard Cain, last of the Horadrim. I've been here for... for too long. The undead keep coming, but they haven't killed me. They seem to be waiting for something."*

*"You must get me out of here. There are things I need to tell you, things you need to know. The Prime Evils are returning, and if we don't act soon, it will be too late. Please, get me out of this place."*

**Escaping Tristram:**

The party must fight their way back to the portal, protecting Cain. The undead will be more aggressive now, sensing that their prize is escaping. Once through the portal, the party can close it behind them, cutting off pursuit.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}

\page

{{descriptive,wide
##### Completion and Reward

The return to the Rogue Encampment is a moment of hope. Word spreads quickly that Deckard Cain has been rescued, and the survivors gather to see the legendary Horadrim. Cain, though weak from his captivity, stands tall, his eyes sharp and his mind clear.

**Returning to the Encampment:**

When the party arrives with Cain, the encampment reacts with a mixture of relief and curiosity. Akara approaches first, her hands clasped together in gratitude.

**Akara:** *"Deckard Cain. I never thought I'd see the day. Welcome, and thank you for coming to our aid."*

**Cain:** *"Thank you, but the gratitude is mine. These heroes saved my life, and in doing so, they've given me a chance to do what I was meant to do—help fight the darkness."*

Cain establishes himself in the encampment, setting up a small tent near Akara's. He's ready to offer his services immediately.

**Reward:** Each player receives 200 XP, a **random magic ring** from Akara (use standard magic ring tables appropriate for the party's level—typically a common or uncommon magic ring), and the party gains access to **Deckard Cain** as a permanent NPC (see page XX for full details). Cain provides:
- Free item identification (unlimited uses)
- Lore exposition about Prime Evils, Horadrim, and Sanctuary's history
- Information about enemies and their weaknesses
- Guidance about quest objectives and their significance

**Akara (Upon Completion):**

**Akara:** *"Deckard Cain! I never thought I would see the day. Thank you, heroes—you have brought us something we desperately needed: knowledge."* She presents each party member with a ring, carefully selecting one from a small chest. *"These are magical rings—not powerful, perhaps, but they may aid you in the battles to come. Take them as a token of our gratitude."*

**Note:** If Cain is not rescued before the party moves on to the next major phase of the adventure, the quest will be considered failed. In this case, the Rogues will eventually attempt to rescue Cain themselves (they may succeed, but at great cost). If rescued by others, Cain will charge 200 gold per identified item instead of providing the service for free, as he has less personal investment in aiding the party.

**Cain (Post-Quest):**

**Cain:** *"Thank you. I owe you my life, and more than that—I owe you my knowledge. There are things I must tell you, things you need to understand about what's happening to Sanctuary."*

*"The Prime Evils—Diablo, Mephisto, Baal—they've been defeated before, but they always return. Their influence corrupts everything it touches, and right now, Andariel serves as their agent here in the West. But she's not the only threat. The darkness is spreading, and we must be prepared."*

*"If you have any magical items you need identified, bring them to me. I can tell you what they truly are, what powers they hold. And if you have questions about what we're facing, I'll answer them as best I can. Knowledge is a weapon, and I intend to use it."*

##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Hard

**Recommended Party Level:** 3-4

**Encounter Balancing:**
- Adjust Treehead Woodfist's minion count based on party size (add 1-2 skeletons per party member beyond 4)

- **NPC Protection:** Players must protect Cain during the escape from Tristram, introducing the challenges and rewards of protecting a non-combatant during dangerous situations
- **Resource Management:** This is a long quest with multiple encounters; players must manage spell slots, hit points, and abilities carefully across an extended adventure

**Roleplay Opportunities:**
- Akara's request shows her wisdom and desperation—she recognizes they need Cain's knowledge
- Warriv's comment about Cain being "half-mad" adds mystery and tension

# Quest 4: The Forgotten Tower

:::::::
*This quest pivots the campaign from rescue operations to treasure hunting and infiltration. The Moldy Tome pushes the party deeper into hostile territory, culminating in a multi-level dungeon crawl against the immortal Countess and her rune-hoarding cult.*{color:#C9AD6A}
{background:#00000090,text-align:center}
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Discovering the Forgotten Tower

The party discovers the **Forgotten Tower** while exploring the Black Marsh (see area description). The tower rises from the marsh like a shattered fang, its stones bleeding tar-black water. As they approach, they may find a **Moldy Tome** lying on the ground near the entrance or discover it inside the tower itself. The book sits upon a stone pedestal or among ruins, its pages fused with age and damp. When opened, runes flare briefly and the following inscription speaks aloud in a hollow whisper:

*"A once-noble Countess was buried alive beneath the tower she had defiled with forbidden rites. Immolated by peasants, yet never slain, she and her treasure remain beneath the Black Marsh, waiting for the brave—or the foolish."*

The tome crumbles into ash after being read, leaving behind a faint ember that points deeper into the tower. When the heroes return to camp, the Rogues react quickly.

**Charsi:** *"So the stories are true. The Countess and her tower still stand out in the Black Marsh. If you're heading that way, keep an eye out for runes or strange alloys—I can work wonders with that stuff."*

**Deckard Cain (after Quest 3):** *"Ah, the Moldy Tome. I remember when that legend was just a fireside tale. If the Countess endures, so too does her hoard of runes. Tread carefully—the very stones of that tower hunger for blood."*
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Quest Objectives

**Quest Trigger:** Discovering the Forgotten Tower in the Black Marsh (optional quest, can be found at any time)

**Quest Givers:** Lore prompt (discovery of tower or Moldy Tome found in Black Marsh), reinforced by Charsi and Deckard Cain

**Location Chain:** Rogue Encampment → Black Marsh → Forgotten Tower → Tower Levels 1–5 → Countess' Lair

**Objectives:**
- Locate the Forgotten Tower in the Black Marsh (or discover it by finding the Moldy Tome nearby)
- Descend through five procedurally dangerous levels, neutralizing demonic forces and corrupted Rogues
- Confront and slay the **Countess** within the lowest chamber (Tower Cellar Level 5)
- Claim the **Runic Cache** and return with whatever intel or materials the Rogues can use

**Completion Rewards:**
- 250 XP per character
- **Runic Cache:** 1d4+1 common runes (see Rune Alcove table), 1 uncommon rune, assorted gold (6d10 each), and a 25% chance for a unique item tied to the Countess
- **Charsi’s Favor:** Access to a one-time free weapon/armor improvement (counts toward later Horadric Malus upgrades once Quest 5 is complete)
- Deckard Cain gains new lore topics about runewords and Zakarum history

**Recommended Party Level:** 4–5

**Estimated Duration:** 3–4 hours (longer if each tower level is fully explored)

{{descriptive,wide
##### Journey to the Black Marsh

The party must navigate to the **Black Marsh**—accessible via the **Dark Wood** or through other connecting paths from earlier areas. Emphasize worsening weather, ankle-deep mire, and demonic totems marking the Countess' territory. Use the Black Marsh encounter table to wear down the party before they even see the tower. The Forgotten Tower can be discovered at any point during exploration of the Black Marsh.

When the tower finally comes into view, read or paraphrase:

*The tower rises like a shattered fang from the marsh. Its stones bleed tar-black water, and faint orange light flickers inside the arrow slits. A massive iron door stands ajar, groaning with every sway of the wind. The smell of burnt hair and incense rolls out to meet you. Whatever ritual began here never truly ended.*

**Approach Notes:**
- Random patrols of **Corrupt Rogues** (1d4 archers) and **Goatmen** (1d3) circle the tower
- A collapsed wagon outside still holds 2d4 alchemist’s fire vials and a half-burned map (advantage on checks to avoid getting lost inside)
- Players examining the exterior (DC 14 Investigation) find a narrow breach that allows stealthy entry onto Level 2, bypassing the entry hall but alerting any sentries there
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Inside the Forgotten Tower

Each floor combines cramped hallways, ritual chambers, and vertical choke points. Use the following guidance to structure the crawl:

| Level | Features & Hazards | Sample Encounters |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1 – Entry Hall** | Twin staircases, collapsing chandeliers (Dex save DC 13 or take 2d6 bludgeoning), blood runes that flare when crossed | 2d4 Corrupt Rogues, 1d2 Goatman Spearmen |
| **Level 2 – Barracks** | Rows of ruined cots; explosive rune traps (Perception DC 14); locked armories (DC 12 Thieves’ Tools) | 1d4 Rogues + 1 Rogue Captain, 1d3 Gargantuan Beasts chained to pillars |
| **Level 3 – Laboratory** | Alchemical vats, screaming spirits bottled in glass (break = wail attack), volatile gases (fire damage triggers mini-explosions) | 1 Corrupt Sorceress (see page XX), 2d4 Skeleton Alchemists, swarm of Ash Rats |
| **Level 4 – Ritual Floor** | Pentagram mosaics granting disadvantage on Wis saves, summoning circles that spawn Fallen each round unless disrupted, secret elevator to L5 | 1d4+1 Fallen Shamans, 1d3 Wraiths, optional miniboss **Ghost of the Seneschal** |
| **Level 5 – Countess’ Lair** | Vault door etched with runes (series of checks or brute force), lava gutters, elevated platforms, rune pillars empowering the Countess | The Countess (see stat block) plus 2d4 Burning Dead and 1d2 Corrupt Sorceresses |

**General Dungeon Rules:**
- **Alarm State:** If any floor’s alarm is triggered, add +1 enemy group to the next floor
- **Resting:** Short rests attract a 50% chance of patrols unless players barricade doors (DC 15 Survival)
- **Rune Pillars:** Destroying a pillar (AC 15, 30 HP, immunity to poison/psychic) weakens the Countess, removing one of her Legendary Actions per pillar destroyed
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Countess Encounter Setup

The final chamber is circular, with molten channels forming a pentagram around a central dais. Four rune pillars hum with infernal energy while charred coffins line the walls. The Countess begins atop the dais, blades drawn, robes trailing embers.

*“I burned for forgiving the wicked. Now I burn for eternity—and so will you.”*

**Battlefield Features:**
- **Rune Pillars (4):** While at least one stands, the Countess gains +2 AC and resists cold/fire. Destroying a pillar deals 10 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet (Dex save DC 14 half) and removes those benefits
- **Molten Channels:** Treat as difficult terrain; creatures that start their turn in the channel take 5 (1d10) fire damage
- **Shadow Balcony:** A raised, broken balcony (20 ft up) from which archers (if any survived) can pester the party

***Rune-Linked Teleport.*** As a bonus action, the Countess can teleport up to 30 feet to another rune inscribed surface she can see.

***Blood for Fire.*** When the Countess scores a critical hit, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her until the end of their next turn.
___
### Actions

##### Looting the Runic Vault

Once the Countess falls, the runic pillars dim and a hidden alcove grinds open. Inside rests the **Runic Cache**—stone shelves piled with coins, gemstones, and rune-marked tablets.

**Runic Cache Table (roll 1d6 twice or choose):**
1. **El Rune** and **Eld Rune** embedded in dagger hilts (treat as spell focuses)  
2. **Tir Rune** granting once-per-day *guiding bolt* when socketed  
3. **Nef Rune** that can be crushed to cast *repelling blast* variant once  
4. 300 gp in Horadric-minted coins and a **Scroll of Fire Shield**  
5. **Countess' Signet** (ring granting fire resistance for 1 minute, 1/day)  
6. **The Tower Map** (advantage on navigation checks in future catacombs)

Allow players to harvest rare reagents (alchemical ash, demon ichor) worth 50 gp each for crafting. Charsi can turn runes into socketed items later, foreshadowing the Horadric Malus quest.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Completion & Aftermath

Returning to the Rogue Encampment with news of the tower’s cleansing lifts morale. Kashya posts additional sentries at the outer walls now that the Black Marsh is safer. Charsi immediately examines any runes, promising breakthroughs once she has the Horadric Malus again.

**Charsi:** *"You actually survived that deathtrap? Incredible. Let me see those runes—I can already tell they'll pair beautifully with the Malus once we recover it."*

**Deckard Cain:** *"The Countess’ obsession with runes nearly doomed an entire province. Let us hope her fall teaches others the cost of unchecked ambition."*

**New Leads:** The tower’s ledgers implicate a demonic smith forging weapons in the Monastery Barracks—the very hook for **Quest 5: Tools of the Trade**.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Moderate–Hard (attrition-based dungeon crawl)

**Recommended Level:** 4–5 (adjust by trimming encounters on upper floors for weaker parties)

**Scaling Tips:**
- Reduce alarm responses or remove one mini-boss if the party lacks magical damage
- Increase rune pillar hit points or add arcane locks for higher-level groups
- Replace some Corrupt Rogues with **Hell Lancers** if you want more melee pressure

**Teaching Moments:**
- **Dungeon Resource Drain:** Demonstrates how multiple short combats tax spell slots and hit dice
- **Trap Awareness:** Encourages marching order, passive Perception, and creative bypasses
- **Boss Mechanics:** Breaking rune pillars gives tangible benefits, reinforcing objective-based combat
- **Treasure Variety:** Introduces runes as a new loot type, setting expectations for Act I’s back half

**Atmosphere & Tone:**
- Lean into crackling firelight, echoing screams from below, and the smell of burnt cloves
- Describe how the tower seems to sigh whenever a door opens, as if exhaling centuries of heat
- Use the Countess’ dialogue to parallel Andariel’s corruption—this is what happens when mortals seek infernal bargains

**Transition to Quest 5:**
- The ledgers and smithing notes point directly to the **Horadric Malus** in the Barracks
- Charsi formally requests the party retrieve the hammer once she sees what runes can do
- Cain warns that the Monastery’s smith, now called **The Smith**, is forging weapons for Andariel—seeding the next major objective

*This quest drags the party through the shattered Monastery complex to steal back the Horadric Malus from The Smith. It blends infiltration, hostage rescue, and a bruising boss fight that sets up the march on Andariel.*

{{descriptive,wide
##### Charsi's Plea

Returning from the Forgotten Tower, the heroes find Charsi pacing beside her forge, soot-stained ledgers from the Countess’ vault spread across the anvil. The parchment details shipment schedules, demonic alloys, and one line circled over and over: *"Horadric Malus relocated to Barracks forge."* Charsi’s hands shake—not from fear, but from the realization that her teachers’ masterpiece still exists, even if it’s been twisted to serve Andariel.

She explains that the Horadric Malus was the Sisterhood’s sacred hammer, a focus that lets her fold runes into steel, awaken latent sockets, and break the enchantments binding demonic alloys. Without it, she can only patch armor and pray. With it, she can arm the camp for the inevitable push into the Monastery. The quest is personal, but it is also strategic—the final assault on Andariel will fail if the heroes can’t keep pace with the weapons coming out of the corrupted forge.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Meeting Charsi

When players speak with Charsi after Quest 4, she addresses them with anxious determination:

**Charsi:** *"The Countess’ ledgers talked about a demon they just call The Smith. He hauled our Horadric Malus back into the Barracks and has been forging weapons for Andariel ever since. If we don’t steal it back, everything we do out there is just patchwork."*

If players ask how to reach the Barracks:

**Charsi:** *"Follow the Tamoe Highland to the Monastery Gate, push through the Outer Cloister, and you’ll smell the forge before you see it. The Barracks connect straight into the Jail—we used to move arms between them. Now they’re crawling with corrupted Rogues and Goatmen enforcers."*

If players probe for tactical advice:

**Charsi:** *"Those ledgers mention alarm gongs on every landing. Move quiet, kill the shamans first, and watch for pressure plates near the armories. If they ring that bell, The Smith will know you’re coming."*

If players ask what she can do with the Malus:

**Charsi:** *"Bring it home and I’ll rework one of your weapons or suits of armor for free. After that, every rune you find turns into something real—sockets, runewords, fire-hardened edges. I swear it."*

**Charsi (Early Return without the Malus):** *"I know it’s a deathtrap. I also know we won’t survive Andariel without that hammer. Catch your breath if you need to, but we have to go back in there."*
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Other NPCs’ Comments (After Initiating Quest)

**Deckard Cain:** *"The Horadric Malus is more than a craftsperson’s tool. It channels patterns first taught to us by the angels. Beware The Smith—he was a mortal once, but the forge remade him into something that knows only pain."*

**Akara:** *"The Barracks and Jail are soaked in the blood of my sisters. Cleanse that place if you can—free the captives, sanctify the armories, and bring the Malus back to hands that honor it."*

**Kashya:** *"I can spare a scout to guide you through the Tamoe Highland, but once you breach the Cloister you’re on your own. Drop the gate chains or light a green flare if you need extraction. Otherwise, finish the job."*

**Gheed:** *"I hear demons pay top coin for enchanted steel. If you find any... surplus... I know buyers. And if you happen across The Smith’s ledger, I’d pay handsomely for a look."*

**Warriv:** *"The path east is narrower than ever. The Highland cliffs will funnel you straight to the gate—expect ambushes on the ridge, and don’t linger when the bells start ringing."*

**Kashya (Early Return):** *"Every hour that hammer stays in demon hands is another hour they forge blades for our throats. Re-arm and get back in there."*

##### Quest Objectives

**Quest Giver:** Charsi (Rogue Encampment)

**Location Chain:** Rogue Encampment → Tamoe Highland → Monastery Gate → Outer Cloister → Barracks → Smith's Forge Hall

**Note:** The Barracks connects to the Jail, but The Smith and the Horadric Malus are located within the Barracks itself, not in the Jail.

**Objective:** Retrieve the Horadric Malus from The Smith so Charsi can restore advanced crafting to the encampment.

**Completion Requirements:**
- Travel through the Tamoe Highland and breach the Monastery Gate (see page XX for area details)
- Infiltrate or clear the Outer Cloister to reach the Barracks entrance
- Navigate the Barracks workshops and adjoining Jail corridors while managing alarms and patrols
- Defeat The Smith inside the forge hall and recover the Horadric Malus
- Return the Malus to Charsi in the Rogue Encampment

**Rewards:**
- 300 XP per character
- Horadric Malus unlocked: Charsi can now socket items, apply masterwork upgrades, and craft rune-enhanced gear (see below)
- One free masterwork upgrade or socket per character
- Access to demonsteel ingots, schematics, and unique loot from The Smith
- Encampment morale boost: Kashya’s mercenaries gain +1 damage on their first attack in the next quest (optional rule)

**Recommended Party Level:** 5 (after completing The Forgotten Tower)

**Estimated Duration:** 3–4 hours of play (longer if the party sweeps every cell block)
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Road to the Monastery

The trek from the Rogue Encampment to the Monastery is longer than any previous excursion. The party must:
- Cross the **Black Marsh** or loop through the **Dark Wood** to reach the **Tamoe Highland**. Use the Highland encounter table (see page XX) to emphasize exposed ridgelines, goatman ambushes, and bitter winds that impose **DC 13 Constitution saves** every hour or suffer one level of exhaustion (optional).
- Approach the **Monastery Gate** where corrupted Rogues have re-rigged the ballistae. A **DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth)** check lets the party bypass the gatehouse; failure triggers a volley (3d10 piercing, Dexterity save half) and raises the first alarm tick.
- Navigate the **Outer Cloister**, now an open-air killing field. Treat each quadrant as difficult terrain filled with collapsed masonry and burning braziers. Secret postern doors (DC 15 Investigation) can drop the party directly into the Barracks mezzanine, rewarding scouting and use of Rogue allies.

Encourage the heroes to secure fallback routes: jamming the gate chains, toppling siege ladders, or leaving chalk symbols for Kashya’s scouts grants advantage on future checks to retreat or bring reinforcements.

##### Barracks & Jail Crawl

| Segment | Key Features & Hazards | Sample Encounters |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Outer Cloister Entry** | Two-story walkways, arrow slits, alarm gongs on chains (DC 14 Thieves’ Tools to disarm). Difficult terrain from collapsed arches, brazier smoke imposes lightly obscured condition. | 2d4 **Corrupt Rogues** (mix melee/archer), 1 **Goatman Spearman**, 1 **Fallen Shaman** ringing the gong. |
| **Barracks Workshops** | Rows of weapon racks, quenching troughs that vent scalding steam every other round (Dex save DC 13 or 2d6 fire). Pressure plates (DC 15 Perception) drop portcullises that split the party. | 1 **Corrupt Captain** with 1d4 **Rogue Trainees**, 1 **Gargantuan Beast** chained to the forge. |
| **Forge Gallery** | Central hall leading to The Smith. Lava channels provide soft cover but deal 1d10 fire to creatures that start their turn adjacent. Cranes swing suspended blades (can be commandeered with DC 14 Strength). | 1 **Corrupt Sorceress**, 2d4 **Skeleton Smelters** (use skeleton stat block with fire damage), environmental hazard wave (falling chimney, etc.). |
| **Upper Jail (Cells & Kennels)** | Rows of barred cells containing terrified refugees or corrupted prisoners. Unlocking cells (DC 14 Thieves’ Tools) without silencing wailing survivors raises alarm. Healing supplies stashed in infirmary (2d4 potions). | 1 **Dark Archer Warden**, 1d4 **Spike Fiends**, optional **Unique Prisoner** (ally or side quest). |
| **Deep Cells & Arsenal** | Spiral stair to forge hall, rune-scribed doors, chanting from Hell-forged apprentices. Weapon racks grant +1 weapons for the encounter if claimed. Alarm lever beside the door triggers reinforcements every other round. | 2 **Burning Dead**, 1 **Corrupt Sorceress**, 1 **Hellforge Acolyte** (use acolyte with fire spells). |
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Optional Goals & Complications

- **Rescue Captives:** Freeing at least three imprisoned Rogues grants the party advantage on one future Stealth or Survival check inside the Monastery. Survivors also deliver intelligence for Quest 6.
- **Sabotage the Forge:** A **DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) or Strength (Athletics)** check disables the rune-powered bellows, imposing disadvantage on demon attack rolls for the rest of this quest and reducing Andariel’s reinforcements later.
- **Secure Supply Caches:** Barracks arsenals hold 2d6 bundles of alchemist’s fire, tanglefoot bags, or holy water. Each cache requires a **DC 13 Investigation** to locate before they’re spirited deeper into the Jail.
- **Silent Approach:** Tracking alarm ticks creates tension. After three alarms, reinforcements equal to 2d4 Corrupt Rogues arrive each round until the party reaches the forge. Reward clever timing, illusions, or disguises that keep the alarm below that threshold.
- **Ledger Snatch:** The Smith’s desk contains manifests naming Andariel’s lieutenants. Delivering these to Deckard Cain grants advantage on lore checks in Quest 6 and unlocks bonus downtime rumors.

##### The Horadric Malus

The Malus is a massive adamant hammer carved with ocular runes. When a hero lifts it from The Smith’s anvil, cold light flashes and every brazier in the forge gutters. Carrying it halves the weight of any nonmagical gear the bearer holds (holy buoyancy) but also makes them shed faint sparks—useful for tracking or dramatic lighting.

**Workshop Benefits (after returning the Malus to Charsi):**
- **Masterwork Temper (1/character):** Each hero chooses one weapon or suit of armor. Charsi upgrades it to a +1 item or adds a bespoke property (flaming, serrated, radiant, etc.) appropriate to the character’s concept.
- **Socketcraft:** Charsi can now add one socket to any weapon/armor/shield per downtime week. Filling a socket requires runes or gems (see page XX for rune tables).
- **Rune Fusion:** Combining at least two runes lets Charsi attempt proto-runewords. Spending 50 gp in materials and succeeding on a **DC 15 Smith’s Tools** check (rolled by the DM) grants an additional minor property.
- **Commissioned Projects:** Future quests may require special gear (holy water grenades, blessed bolts, etc.). With the Malus, Charsi can craft such items at half cost and in half the downtime, giving the party a tangible edge heading into Quest 6.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### The Smith Encounter

The forge hall is a vaulted chamber where molten metal pours through rune-lined channels. The Smith stands at the center, chained to the anvil by choice, each swing sending shockwaves across the floor. When the party enters, read or paraphrase:

*“Heat slams into you like a wall. Chains rattle overhead, glowing rivulets of metal trace sigils in the air, and a hulking figure turns to face you. Flesh fused with iron. Eyes like forge coals. In his fist, the Horadric Malus—perverted, yet still holy. The Smith bellows, and the walls answer.”*

**Battlefield Features:**
- **Molten Channels:** Difficult terrain; creatures that fall prone adjacent to a channel take 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Hanging Chains:** Medium or smaller creatures can swing across the hall (DC 13 Athletics) to avoid lava or reach balconies. The Smith can rip a chain free as a legendary action.
- **Runic Bellows:** A console near the entrance can be sabotaged (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)) to impose disadvantage on The Smith’s fire attacks for the rest of the fight.
- **Weapon Racks:** Grabbing a blessed glaive or shield grants +1 to attack or AC for the encounter but takes an action.

**Combat Phases:**
- **Phase 1 – Slam Shock:** The Smith focuses on frontline characters, using Molten Rush to close gaps and knock foes prone. Reinforcement waves of 1d4 Burning Dead pour in every other round if the alarm was triggered.
- **Phase 2 – Bellows Burst (below 60% HP):** He shatters the Malus’ bindings, causing magma splashes (Dex save DC 15 or 3d8 fire). He also begins hurling Cinderbursts down the length of the forge.
- **Phase 3 – Enraged Tempest (below 30% HP):** The Smith ignites, gaining temporary hit points and attempting to grapple a character, dragging them toward the anvil for a coup de grâce. Destroying the rune pillars lining the walls (AC 15, 25 HP) ends this frenzy.

Defeating him without destroying the Malus requires called shots (declare nonlethal intent) or a **DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** check at the start of the final blow to wrest the hammer away mid-swing.

##### Completion & Rewards

When the party pries the Malus from demon hands, the forge keens like a bell. Flames flicker out, alarms fall silent, and any surviving prisoners bow in stunned relief. Carrying the hammer imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks (it hums audibly), but grants advantage on saving throws against fear effects as long as it is borne openly.

Back in the Rogue Encampment, the reception is immediate:

**Charsi:** *"I can feel the forge breathe again. Lay your gear out—I’ll start with the worst dents and work my way to miracles."*

**Deckard Cain:** *"The Horadrim would be proud. With this tool restored, we can inscribe the runic blessings Andariel fears most."*

**Akara:** *"The Monastery trembles; I can feel it. This is the turning point. Prepare yourselves—the Cathedral will not surrender easily."*

**Kashya:** *"With those weapons, my Rogues might stand a chance in the Cloister halls. Say the word and we march on the Inner Cloister."*

**Gheed:** *"Newly-forged steel floods the market? Music to my ears. If Charsi needs rare reagents, tell her Gheed knows people."*

**Warriv:** *"Hope is a dangerous thing—but I’ll take danger over despair. When you head east, my caravan will be ready."*

**Quest Rewards Recap:**
- 300 XP per character
- Horadric Malus returned; each hero receives one free upgrade or socket from Charsi
- Access to new crafting menus: masterwork tempering, socketing, rune fusion (as described above)
- Loot from The Smith’s forge: 3d6 x 10 gp in demonsteel bars, 1d4 potions of fire resistance, 25% chance of a unique weapon such as **The Smith’s Brand** (see magic items section)
- Rescued prisoners provide intelligence that grants advantage on the first skill check made inside the Monastery during Quest 6

With the forge reclaimed, Kashya and Akara formally brief the party on **Quest 6: Sisters to the Slaughter**, the assault on the Inner Cloister, Catacombs, and Andariel herself.

{{descriptive,wide
##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Hard (attrition-based gauntlet plus a CR 7 boss). Expect 4–6 medium encounters before The Smith.

**Scaling Tips:**
- Remove one patrol or legendary action for smaller/less-optimized parties.
- Allow Kashya to loan a Rogue scout (use the *Scout* stat block) if the group lacks stealth or trap skills.
- For hardened parties, add a second Hellforge Acolyte in the forge hall and increase The Smith’s hit points to 180.

**Teaching Moments:**
- Highlight infiltration vs. assault by tracking alarm ticks openly.
- Showcase environmental hazards (lava, chains, pressure plates) to encourage creative tactics.
- Introduce crafting as a reward loop: success unlocks new downtime options, failure keeps the party under-geared.

**Loot Suggestions:**
- **The Smith’s Brand:** +1 great maul that deals an extra 1d6 fire damage and casts *heat metal* (1/day).
- **Runed Shackles:** Restrains a fiend for 1 minute (DC 15 Strength to break); invaluable for Andariel’s lieutenants.
- **Demonsteel Ingots:** Each ingot counts as 75 gp worth of crafting materials when presented to Charsi.

**Fail Forward:**
- If the party retreats, increase the alarm level next time; reinforcements arrive sooner and The Smith gains advantage on initiative.
- If the Malus is damaged, Akara can lead a purification ritual (skill challenge) that delays crafting but still moves the story forward.

**Transition to Quest 6:**
- Kashya convenes a war council once Charsi begins forging upgraded gear.
- Akara senses Andariel’s anguish beneath the Cathedral, pointing the heroes toward the Catacombs.
- Deckard Cain translates manifests recovered from the Barracks, providing tactical intel for the final assault.

Completing Quest 5 should feel like flipping the campaign’s momentum—the heroes finally control the forge, and Sanctuary’s last defenders are ready to strike back.

{{descriptive,wide
##### War Council

With the Horadric Malus restored, the Rogue Encampment convenes its first true war council since the fall of the Monastery. Kashya spreads hand-sketched floor plans across Charsi’s anvil while Akara places holy sigils at each choke point. Deckard Cain recites everything he remembers about Andariel’s rituals, and Charsi’s newly empowered forge spits sparks that feel like omens.

The plan is simple only on paper: breach the Outer Cloister, secure the Inner Cloister courtyard, descend through Jail Levels 2–3 into the Inner Cloister proper, and then press through the Catacombs until Andariel’s sanctum is breached. Warriv offers his caravan as a mobile infirmary, backing it against the palisade so that wounded Rogues can be dragged away and those bound for Lut Gholein will have a ready transport.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Meeting the Leaders

When players report in after Quest 5, run the following exchanges to set tone and stakes:

**Akara:** *"The Maiden of Anguish festers beneath the Cathedral. She feeds on every loss we have suffered. Cleanse the catacombs and sever her link to the Hells. I will consecrate the altar once you are done."*

**Kashya:** *"My scouts will keep the gate open, but we can’t hold it forever. Drop signal flares if you clear a level—we move forward only when you say it’s safe."*

**Charsi:** *"I tempered your weapons to bite deep. Take these distilled oils—coat your blades before you enter the Catacombs and they’ll burn through demon flesh."* *(Each character gains two vials of Holy Oil; as a bonus action, apply to a weapon to add +1d4 radiant damage for 1 minute.)*

**Deckard Cain:** *"Andariel is a creature of torment. Expect illusions, whispers, promises. Steel your minds as well as your bodies. I will be waiting at the gate to identify whatever relics you recover."*

**Warriv:** *"Once she falls, we ride east. My caravan leaves with the dawn—you’ll have seats of honor."*

##### Quest Objectives

**Quest Trigger:** Completion of Quest 5 (Tools of the Trade) and briefing with Akara and Kashya

**Quest Givers:** Akara (spiritual mandate), Kashya (military objective), Deckard Cain (lore support)

**Location Chain:** Rogue Encampment → Tamoe Highland → Monastery Gate → Outer Cloister → Jail → Inner Cloister → Cathedral → Catacombs Levels 1–4 → Andariel's Lair (Catacombs Level 4)

**Note:** The Barracks can be accessed from the Outer Cloister, but for Quest 6, players proceed directly through the Jail to reach the Inner Cloister and Cathedral. The Barracks area was already cleared during Quest 5.

**Objective:** Kill Andariel and purge the Catacombs so the Sisterhood can reclaim the Monastery and Sanctuary can breathe again.

**Completion Requirements:**
- Secure the Outer Cloister so Kashya’s forces can establish a forward camp
- Clear a path through the Jail and Inner Cloister to reach the Cathedral nave
- Descend through Catacombs Levels 1–4, neutralizing ritual hotspots and venom vats
- Defeat Andariel in her lair and consecrate the corrupted altar
- Return to the Rogue Encampment, report success, and decide whether to travel east with Warriv

**Rewards:**
- 500 XP per character (plus Andariel’s XP value)
- Access to Act II (travel to Lut Gholein via Warriv)
- Unique loot from Andariel’s treasury (see Completion & Rewards)
- Permanent morale bonus: Rogues at the Encampment gain +2 to attack rolls during any future defense scenes
- Each character gains a **Favor of the Sisterhood** charm (grants advantage on one saving throw of the player’s choice during Act II)

**Recommended Party Level:** 5–6

**Estimated Duration:** 4–6 hours of play (multi-session finale)

##### Assault Blueprint

The heroes can choose between a full-on assault (loud, fast, overwhelming) or a stealthy infiltration (slow, surgical, dependent on Recon tokens earned in previous quests). Track an **Alarm Meter** as in Quest 5; once it hits 3, Andariel becomes aware of the party and begins corrupting terrain in deeper levels (poison vents activate, reinforcements ripple through). Encourage players to spend downtime prepping traps, holy water, or alliances with rescued Rogues—each meaningful preparation can reduce the initial alarm by 1 or grant advantage on the first encounter of a floor.

- **Outer Cloister:** Ruined courtyard with collapsing colonnades. Treat the area as difficult terrain until players secure it (Skill Challenge: Athletics, Acrobatics, Survival DC 14). Once cleared, Kashya station guards here, giving the party a safe short-rest node.
- **Jail Levels 2–3:** Narrow corridors filled with torture implements turned into summoning foci. Environmental hazard: screaming walls impose Wisdom saves vs. fright each hour unless sanctified (Religion DC 15).
- **Inner Cloister & Cathedral:** Sanctified once, now defiled. Desecrated fonts burst with poison if not sealed (Arcana or Medicine DC 14). Choir loft archers (Corrupt Rogues) pin the party unless dealt with quickly.
- **Catacombs:** Four stacked dungeon levels, each thematically sharper (bones, fungus, slime, obsidian).

##### Catacomb Encounter Ladder

| Level | Features & Hazards | Sample Encounters |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Catacombs 1 – Reliquary** | Flickering braziers, fallen statues, holy relics coated in bile. Desecrated altars impose disadvantage on Wisdom saves until purified. | 1 **Corrupt Zealot Captain**, 2d4 **Skeleton Archers**, 1 **Wraith** phasing between pews. |
| **Catacombs 2 – Venom Vats** | Pools of green toxin; each round, roll d6 to see if vapors surge (Con save DC 14 or take 2d6 poison). Destroy vats (30 HP each) to weaken Andariel. | 1 **Venom Sorceress**, 2 **Poison Spitters** (use *Giant Spider* template), hazard: rupturing vats. |
| **Catacombs 3 – Web Galleries** | Ceiling-high webs, cocoons holding prisoners (some alive). Webs count as difficult terrain and restrain on failed Dex save DC 13. | 2d4 **Plague Crawlers**, 1 **Unique Mini-boss: Sister Lycandra** (revenant rogue), plus random captive rescue event. |
| **Catacombs 4 – The Bearing Crypts** | Pillars carved with screaming faces; runes pulse with green fire. Lair wards empower demons (+2 AC) until four pylons destroyed. | 1 **Pit Lord Echo** (use *Barbed Devil*), 1 **Corrupt High Priestess**, environmental pillar explosions. |
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Optional Operations

- **Purify Altars:** Each level contains a desecrated altar. Spending 10 minutes and succeeding on a DC 15 Religion check removes a point from the Alarm Meter or grants a d4 Inspiration die usable in the Catacombs.
- **Rescue Survivors:** Cocoons and cells contain surviving Rogues, artisans, or townsfolk. Freeing at least five grants the party a permanent +1 bonus to Persuasion checks with Sisterhood NPCs in future acts.
- **Disable Venom Vats:** Destroying vats on Catacombs 2 reduces Andariel’s Poison Nova damage by 1d6 per vat.
- **Secure War Spoils:** Locked reliquaries hold scrolls, holy water, and unique arrows. For every two reliquaries opened (Dex DC 14 or knock spell), Charsi can craft an additional masterwork upgrade during Act II downtime.
- **Scout Exit Routes:** A DC 15 Survival check per level identifies safe retreat paths. If the party needs to withdraw, they gain advantage on initiative while fleeing and avoid getting trapped by collapsing tunnels.

##### Andariel’s Sanctum

The final chamber is a cavernous cistern beneath the Cathedral. Webs stretch between obsidian columns. Rivers of poison drip from the ceiling into blood-filled fonts. Four rune-lit braziers empower Andariel; each can be extinguished with holy water or a DC 15 Athletics check to topple it (deals 3d6 fire damage to adjacent creatures). The floor forms a sigil-channel; crossing the lines without neutralizing them deals 1d6 psychic damage per square.

Read or paraphrase:

*"The air itself tastes bitter. Green vapors coil around a towering silhouette—four arms, barbed legs, a crown of horns slick with venom. Her voice is a whisper across your skin: 'Anguish will teach you obedience.' The braziers flare, and the Maiden of Anguish strikes."*

### Traits
***Aura of Anguish.*** Creatures that start their turn within 20 feet of Andariel must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and be frightened until the end of their turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to the aura for 24 hours.  
:
***Spider Queen.*** Andariel can move through webs without impediment and climb difficult surfaces, including upside down, without needing to make an ability check.  
:
***Venomous Blood.*** When a creature within 5 feet hits Andariel with a melee attack, it takes 5 (1d10) poison damage.  
:
***Limited Magic Resistance.*** Andariel has advantage on saving throws against spells, and she forces disadvantage on concentration checks triggered by her damage.

___
### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Andariel makes two *Poison Lance* attacks or one *Poison Lance* attack and one *Tail Impale*.  
:
***Poison Lance.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned this way, the target also takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  
:
***Tail Impale.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be restrained (escape DC 17).  
:
***Poison Nova (Recharge 5–6).*** Andariel releases a 40-foot-radius burst of toxic mist. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are also poisoned until the end of their next turn.  
:
***Summon Tormented (1/Day).*** Andariel summons 1d4 *Tormented Souls* (use Wraith stat block) in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet. The souls act on her initiative, immediately after her turn.

___
### Legendary Actions
Andariel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. She regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

***Anguished Step.*** Andariel moves up to half her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
***Venom Spray.*** Andariel targets one creature she can see within 30 feet; the target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage and be coated in venom, granting advantage to the next attack against it before Andariel’s next turn.  
***Tail Whip (Costs 2 Actions).*** Andariel makes one *Tail Impale* attack.  
***Agony Pulse (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each creature of her choice within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage and be pushed 10 feet.

___
### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Andariel can use one of the following lair actions while in her chamber:
1. **Poison Jets.** Two vents erupt, targeting up to two creatures within 60 feet. Each must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failure, or half on a success.  
2. **Web Snare.** Sticky webs shoot from the ceiling, forcing each creature of Andariel’s choice within 30 feet to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.  
3. **Torment Echo.** Whispering voices fill the lair. Creatures that fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw cannot benefit from temporary hit points until the next round.
}}

\page

{{descriptive,wide
##### Combat Phases & Tactics

**Phase 1 – Anguish Rising (Full HP to 150 HP):**
- Andariel controls space with Poison Lance reach, pushing intruders into poisonous rivulets.
- She focuses on spellcasters and healers, forcing concentration checks via Tail Impale.
- Braziers grant her +2 AC and resistance to radiant damage until extinguished.

**Phase 2 – Venom Flood (150 HP to 70 HP):**
- Poison Nova recharges faster (roll with advantage) if at least one venom vat remains intact.
- Tormented Souls harass backliners; destroying a soul weakens the aura for a round.
- Web Snare lair action triggers automatically every other round unless the party burned the webs earlier (torch, alchemist’s fire, etc.).

**Phase 3 – Desperation (70 HP and below):**
- Andariel gains advantage on attacks against frightened targets.
- She uses Anguished Step to reposition after each legendary Tail Whip, dragging heroes into acid pools.
- If reduced to 0 HP while at least one braizer is active, she instead explodes into toxic mist, dropping to 1 HP and immediately using Poison Nova (this can happen only once).

**Tactical Advice:**
- Encourage players to coordinate: extinguish braziers, destroy pylons, and use holy water to suppress Aura of Anguish (grants advantage vs. the aura for 1 round).
- Remind them that the Alarm Meter influences reinforcement waves; high alarm might add extra Tormented Souls each round.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Completion & Rewards

When Andariel dies, her body collapses into ash and tar. The braziers gutter out, and the catacombs’ oppressive pressure releases in a roar of wind. Akara arrives with a contingent of Rogues to sanctify the altar—if the party purified altars earlier, the ritual completes in minutes; otherwise it becomes a longer downtime scene (opportunity for roleplay and skill checks).

**Loot Suggestions:**
- **Rogue’s Vengeance (Unique Bow):** +1 longbow; once per short rest, its wielder can add 2d6 poison or radiant damage to a hit.
- **Veil of Anguish (Crown):** Grants resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against frightened, but imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks while worn.
- **Blood of the Maiden (Potion):** As *heroism* spell plus immunity to poison for 1 hour.
- Treasure hoard worth 1,000 gp in gold, gems, and relics suitable for Act II trade; roll twice on the Magic Item Table F for additional rewards.

**NPC Reactions:**
- **Akara:** *"Your courage has restored the Sisterhood’s heart. We will keep this ground holy in your absence."*
- **Kashya:** *"Andariel’s head will hang above our gate, a warning to every demon that still breathes."*
- **Charsi:** *"With the forge and the catacombs cleansed, we can start rebuilding. I’ll keep crafting while you’re gone."*
- **Deckard Cain:** *"Sanctuary endures another day. Now we must face what lies beyond the desert."*
- **Warriv:** *"Pack your belongings. The caravan rolls at dawn."*
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Epilogue: Warriv’s Caravan

After a night of solemn celebration, Warriv assembles the caravan at the Encampment gate. Wagons creak under the weight of salvaged weapons, rescued refugees, and the hopes of an entire region. Run the following beats:

- **Farewell Feast:** Rogues share smoked venison and watered wine. Each NPC offers a final toast or personal request (Akara asks the party to send word if they find surviving sisters in the East; Charsi begs for exotic metals; Kashya promises to hold the Monastery).
- **Warriv’s Oath:** *"The road to Lut Gholein is long, treacherous, and full of stories. While you ride with me, you ride under my protection. Once we reach the jewel of the desert, your war continues—just with new enemies."*
- **Travel Hook:** The caravan departs at sunrise. Describe the party looking back at the Rogue Encampment, now lit with fresh braziers and hopeful banners, before turning east toward the deserts. End Act I here, or fast-forward to the Lut Gholein docking area to open Act II.
}}

{{descriptive,wide
##### Game Master Notes

**Quest Difficulty:** Deadly. Expect multiple long rests across safe nodes or return trips to camp.

**Scaling Tips:**
- For weaker parties, reduce Poison Nova damage (8d6) and remove one lair action option.
- For veteran tables, add scripted reinforcements every 3 rounds (1d4 Corrupt Zealots) and increase Andariel’s HP to 260.
- Allow players to leverage previous side quests—freed prisoners, captured intel, or alliances can negate certain hazards entirely.

**Teaching Moments:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Long dungeon gauntlets test rationing of spells, hit dice, and consumables.
- **Environmental Combat:** Braziers, poison vats, and webs emphasize objective-based fights.
- **Narrative Payoff:** This quest should resolve NPC arcs (Charsi’s guilt, Kashya’s leadership, Akara’s faith) while seeding Act II mysteries.

**Failure States:**
- If the party retreats, Andariel fortifies the catacombs (new traps, higher alarm). Provide story consequences: more refugees die, Kashya loses scouts, etc., but keep the quest winnable.
- If Andariel escapes (she can plane shift at 25 HP if the GM wishes), she becomes a recurring nemesis in Act II+.

**Transition to Act II:**
- Warriv’s caravan takes 10 days to reach Lut Gholein. Use the journey for downtime scenes, travel encounters, or Act II foreshadowing (visions from Deckard, rogue desert scouts, rumors of Tal Rasha).
- Begin Act II with the caravan cresting the dunes and the glittering city coming into view, or with the party already in Lut Gholein’s bazaar receiving their next hook.

# The Blood Moor

The wilds beyond the Rogue Encampment begin with the Blood Moor, a stretch of windswept grasslands scarred by recent battles and demonic corruption. Once a quiet frontier dotted with farmsteads, it is now a desolate expanse where abandoned wagons rot in the tall grass and the earth itself seems sickened. Broken fences lean at odd angles, crude demon totems jut from the soil, and small packs of Fallen skitter among smoldering remnants of ruined camps. The sky hangs low and gray, carrying the smell of damp earth and smoke, and every rustle in the brush suggests something watching from just beyond your sight. It is a landscape in mourning—still familiar, yet irrevocably changed.

The terrain itself betrays the violence that swept through. What once were fields now run wild with thistles and brambles, their growth twisted and unnaturally sharp. Shallow depressions mark where structures once stood—farmsteads, barns, trading posts—now reduced to ash and memory. The ground is uneven in places, soft where recent fighting churned the soil, hard-packed where blood has dried and caked. Streams that once ran clear now carry a faint metallic tang, their banks littered with rusting armor and broken weapons. Paths that were once well-traveled have become overgrown and treacherous, forcing travelers to navigate by landmarks that no longer feel trustworthy.

Weather adds to the oppressive atmosphere. Mist clings to the low ground in the early hours, obscuring vision and muffling sounds. When the wind picks up, it carries with it the promise of rain that never quite falls, leaving the air heavy and damp. The constant cloud cover blocks out the sun, casting everything in muted grays and browns. Even during the day, the light feels thin and exhausted, as if the very daylight is reluctant to touch this cursed ground. Those who venture into the Blood Moor quickly learn to trust their instincts over their eyes—what you can't see is often what you should fear most.

# The Den of Evil
#
Beneath the Blood Moor, hidden within the earth itself, lies the Den of Evil—a network of caves and tunnels warped by demonic corruption. What might once have been natural caverns or old mine workings has been transformed into something far more sinister. The walls seem to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, stone formations twist into shapes that suggest writhing forms, and the very air carries a metallic tang that burns the throat. The darkness here is not merely the absence of light; it feels alive, hungry, pressing in from all sides.

The passageways twist and turn in ways that defy natural logic, creating a maze designed to trap the unwary. Narrow corridors open abruptly into vast chambers where the ceiling disappears into shadow, while broad tunnels suddenly constrict into tight squeezes that force single-file passage. Stalactites hang like fangs overhead, and stalagmites rise like broken teeth from the floor. In places, the stone itself appears to have been melted and reformed, leaving smooth surfaces that gleam oddly in torchlight. Pools of dark water collect in low areas, their surfaces oily and still, reflecting nothing but deeper darkness.

Sound behaves strangely here—whispers echo from impossible directions, footfalls seem to come from behind when no one is there, and the drip of water takes on an almost rhythmic quality that sets teeth on edge. The deeper you go, the more the natural world recedes, replaced by something that feels fundamentally wrong. The air grows colder without reason, and the silence between echoes becomes heavier, as if the very caverns are holding their breath, waiting. Those who enter the Den of Evil often find themselves questioning what is real and what is merely shadow and fear—but in this place, the shadows have teeth, and the fear is well-founded.

# Cold Plains

The Cold Plains stretch beyond the Blood Moor, a windswept expanse where the temperature drops unnaturally and the wind cuts like a blade. What should be rolling grasslands have become a frozen wasteland, the ground hard and unforgiving beneath a thin layer of frost that never fully melts. The sky here is perpetually overcast, and the air carries a chill that seeps into bones and saps strength. Ruined watchtowers dot the landscape like broken teeth, their stones blackened by fire and their purpose long forgotten. The wind howls across the plains, carrying with it the distant sounds of battle and the promise of worse things to come.

The terrain itself offers little comfort. The ground is uneven, frozen in places where pools once stood, creating treacherous patches of ice that wait to trip the unwary. Scattered rocks and boulders provide the only cover, but they also hide what might be lurking behind them. The grass that grows here is brittle and brown, crackling underfoot like old bones. Streams have frozen solid, their surfaces marked by the tracks of things that shouldn't exist in such cold. The few trees that dot the landscape are skeletal, their branches bare and reaching like gnarled fingers against the gray sky.

The cold here is more than just weather—it feels intentional, malicious. Even when the wind dies down, the chill remains, pressing in from all sides. Those who travel through the Cold Plains find themselves moving faster, driven not just by the need to escape the cold but by something deeper—a primal sense that this place doesn't want them here, that the very air itself resents their presence. The silence between gusts of wind is heavy and watchful, as if the plains themselves are holding their breath, waiting for something to happen.

##### The Cave

Hidden within the Cold Plains, the Cave is a natural formation that has been corrupted by demonic influence. The entrance gapes like a wound in the earth, exhaling air that smells of damp stone and something far worse. Inside, the passages are narrow and treacherous, with walls that seem to close in the deeper you venture. Water drips from the ceiling in a steady rhythm, collecting in pools that reflect nothing but darkness. The cave feels alive in the worst way—every echo seems intentional, every shadow seems to move with purpose. Those who enter find themselves questioning whether the walls are truly stone or something else entirely.

The deeper chambers reveal the cave's true nature. Stalactites hang like fangs, and stalagmites rise like broken teeth from the floor. The stone formations twist into unnatural shapes, suggesting faces and forms that shouldn't exist in nature. In places, the walls seem to pulse, as if something massive is moving just beyond the stone. The pools of water that collect on the floor are dark and still, their surfaces oily and reflective in a way that suggests they show more than just what's above them. The air grows thicker the deeper you go, until each breath feels like you're inhaling the cave itself.

Sound behaves strangely here, echoing in ways that defy physics and logic. A whisper from one direction might seem to come from another, and the drip of water takes on an almost rhythmic quality that sets teeth on edge. The silence between sounds is absolute and oppressive, making every noise seem louder and more significant than it should be. Those who venture too deep often find themselves lost, not just in space but in something deeper—a sense of disorientation that goes beyond simple confusion. The cave doesn't just trap you physically; it traps you in time, making minutes feel like hours and hours feel like days.

##### Burial Grounds

The Burial Grounds are a testament to the dead who rest uneasily beneath Sanctuary's soil. What was once a peaceful cemetery has become a place of horror, where graves have been desecrated and the earth itself seems to reject the sanctity of final rest. Headstones lie broken and scattered, their inscriptions worn away by time and malice. The ground is uneven, marked by fresh disturbances that suggest the graves have been opened from within. An unnatural silence hangs over the grounds, broken only by the sound of earth shifting and the distant moans of things that should not be moving. The air here is thick with the smell of decay and something else—the metallic tang of necromantic magic.

The layout of the grounds tells a story of gradual corruption. The older graves, those farthest from whatever corruption first touched this place, still stand relatively intact, their markers weathered but whole. But the closer you get to the center, the more pronounced the damage becomes. Graves have been torn open, their contents removed or transformed. The earth around them is churned and disturbed, as if something has been digging its way out from below. Statues of angels and guardians have been defaced or toppled, their faces scratched away or their forms twisted into parodies of protection.

Time seems to move differently here. The light, what little there is, feels wrong—too dim during the day, too bright at night when the moon touches the broken stones. The silence is not the peaceful quiet of a resting place but something else entirely—a watchful, hungry silence that suggests something is waiting just beneath the surface. Those who walk these grounds often feel as though they're being watched from the corner of their eye, but when they turn, there's nothing there—nothing visible, at least. The Burial Grounds have become a place where the boundary between life and death has been blurred, and where the dead no longer stay dead.

##### Mausoleum

The Mausoleum stands as a monument to the dead, its stone walls weathered but still imposing. Once a place of reverence and remembrance, it has been defiled by dark forces. The entrance is flanked by statues of weeping angels, their faces now cracked and stained. Inside, the air is stale and heavy, thick with the dust of ages and the weight of sorrow. Crypts line the walls, their doors hanging open or shattered entirely. The architecture speaks of a time when death was treated with respect, but now the building serves only as a reminder that even the dead are not safe from the corruption spreading across Sanctuary.

The interior is a study in violation. The crypts that once held the honored dead now stand empty or contain things that were never meant to be there. The stone sarcophagi have been broken open, their lids shattered or thrown aside. The intricate carvings that once told stories of lives lived and legacies left behind have been defaced, their meanings lost to scratches and gouges. The floor is covered in a layer of dust and debris that seems to move when you're not looking directly at it. The air itself feels wrong—too still, too heavy, as if the building is holding its breath.

Light behaves strangely within these walls. What should be shadows cast by torchlight or daylight streaming through windows instead seems to move independently, pooling in corners where no light source exists or avoiding areas where light should be strongest. The silence is absolute and oppressive, broken only by the occasional sound of stone shifting or something moving in the darkness beyond sight. The Mausoleum has become a tomb not just for the dead but for hope itself, a place where the finality of death has been perverted into something far worse—a beginning rather than an end.

##### The Crypt

Beneath the Burial Grounds lies the Crypt, a network of underground chambers where the honored dead were once laid to rest. The passages are narrow and low-ceilinged, forcing visitors to stoop and move carefully. The walls are lined with burial niches, most of which are now empty—their occupants having been called back to a mockery of life. The air is thick with the smell of old bones and embalming spices gone sour. Torchlight flickers strangely here, casting shadows that seem to move independently. The deeper chambers are the worst, where the silence becomes absolute and the weight of all that death presses down like a physical force.

The architecture of the Crypt speaks to its original purpose—a place of final rest, designed with care and respect. The passages wind in deliberate patterns, creating a maze that was meant to protect the dead from disturbance. But that protection has failed. The niches that line the walls have been emptied, their contents removed or transformed. The stone shelves where bodies once rested now hold only dust and decay. In places, the walls themselves seem to have been clawed at, as if something was trying to escape from within them. The Crypt has become less a resting place and more a staging ground, where the dead are prepared for a second, unnatural life.

The deeper you venture into the Crypt, the more the normal rules of reality seem to break down. Distances become impossible to judge—a passage that looks short might take minutes to traverse, while a long hallway might be crossed in seconds. The air grows colder without reason, and the silence becomes so absolute that your own heartbeat sounds like thunder. The walls seem to pulse in time with some unseen rhythm, and the very stone appears to breathe. The Crypt is no longer a place where death ends—it's a place where death begins again, in ways that should never have been possible.

##### Stony Field

The Stony Field is a rocky expanse where the ground is more stone than soil. Boulders and outcroppings create natural barriers and hiding places, making navigation difficult and dangerous. The terrain is uneven and treacherous, with hidden crevices and sudden drops that can catch the unwary. The stones themselves seem wrong—their shapes too angular, their surfaces too smooth in places, as if they were shaped by something other than natural erosion. The field is dotted with the remains of old structures, their foundations still visible among the rocks. The wind here has a different quality, howling through the stone formations and creating an eerie music that sets teeth on edge.

The rocks that dominate the landscape are arranged in patterns that suggest intention rather than chance. Some form natural corridors that funnel travelers in specific directions. Others cluster together in ways that create perfect ambush points. The boulders themselves are marked with strange symbols and patterns that seem to writhe when viewed from the corner of the eye. The ground between the rocks is uneven, marked by hidden pits and sudden rises that make every step a gamble. The few paths that wind through the field are narrow and winding, clearly made by those who knew the dangers and were trying to avoid them.

The wind that sweeps across the Stony Field carries with it more than just cold and dust. It brings sounds that shouldn't exist—whispers that might be voices, scrapes that might be claws on stone, thumps that might be footsteps. The stone formations act like natural amplifiers, making distant sounds seem close and close sounds seem distant. The field is a place of confusion, where direction becomes meaningless and every rock looks the same. Those who enter often find themselves going in circles, returning to places they've already passed without realizing they've doubled back. The Stony Field doesn't just hide threats—it hides itself, making navigation nearly impossible for those who don't know its secrets.

##### Tristram

Tristram was once a thriving town, a beacon of civilization in the wilderness. Now it stands as a monument to failure and loss. The buildings are burned-out shells, their roofs collapsed and their walls blackened by fire. The streets are littered with debris—broken carts, scattered belongings, and the bones of those who could not escape. The town square, once a place of gathering, is now a charred ruin where nothing grows. The church that once stood as the town's heart is a hollowed-out wreck, its bell tower leaning precariously. Tristram is a ghost of itself, haunted not just by the dead but by the memory of what was lost. The air here tastes of ash and regret.

Walking through Tristram is like walking through a graveyard made of memories. The buildings still stand in their rows, but they're empty shells, their windows like sightless eyes staring out at nothing. The signs of normal life remain—a child's toy half-buried in ash, a merchant's stall still holding its wares, a door hanging open as if someone left in a hurry. But the people are gone, and what's left behind tells stories of sudden terror and desperate flight. The streets themselves are marked by the chaos of that final day—overturned carts, dropped weapons, scattered coins that no one stopped to collect.

The silence in Tristram is worse than the silence of a natural ruin. This is a place where life was violently cut short, and the absence of that life creates a vacuum that seems to draw in all sound and light. Even during the day, the shadows are too deep, pooling in doorways and alleys where darkness should have no place. At night, the ruins take on a life of their own, with lights flickering in empty windows and sounds coming from buildings that should be vacant. Tristram is not just a dead town—it's a town that refuses to stay dead, haunting itself with the echo of what it used to be.

##### The Underground Passage

The Underground Passage is a network of tunnels that connects different areas of the wilderness, carved through the earth by unknown hands for unknown purposes. The passages are wide enough for travel but narrow enough to feel claustrophobic, with walls that seem to press in from all sides. The air is stale and still, carrying the smell of damp earth and something else—something that suggests these tunnels were never meant for the living. Support beams line the walls at intervals, their wood old and splintered, and the ceiling drips constantly with moisture. The deeper you go, the more the passage feels less like a tunnel and more like a throat, swallowing you whole.

The construction of the passage suggests it was made with haste and desperation rather than careful planning. The walls are rough and uneven, marked by tool marks that speak of rapid digging. The support beams are placed irregularly, some leaning at dangerous angles, others already collapsed and blocking the way. The floor is uneven and treacherous, marked by sudden drops and hidden holes. In places, the ceiling has collapsed entirely, leaving piles of rubble that must be navigated carefully. The passage was clearly meant to be temporary, a way to move quickly and secretly from one place to another, but it has become permanent, a scar in the earth that refuses to heal.

The sense of being underground is oppressive in a way that goes beyond mere claustrophobia. The weight of the earth above feels like a physical pressure, pressing down from all sides. The darkness is absolute when torches fail, and the silence is so complete that every sound—the drip of water, the scrape of a boot, the sound of your own breathing—echoes endlessly. The passage seems to go on forever, twisting and turning in ways that make it impossible to judge distance or direction. Time loses meaning here, and those who travel through the Underground Passage often emerge feeling as if they've been gone far longer than they actually have. The passage doesn't just connect places—it connects states of being, moving you from the world above to something else entirely.

##### Dark Wood

The Dark Wood is a forest that has been corrupted by demonic influence, its trees twisted into unnatural shapes. What should be a place of natural beauty has become a nightmare of gnarled branches and grasping roots. The canopy is so thick that almost no light penetrates, leaving the forest floor in perpetual twilight. The trees themselves seem alive in the worst way—their bark forms patterns that suggest faces, their branches reach out like claws. The undergrowth is thick and treacherous, hiding things that move in the shadows. The air is heavy with the smell of decay and something else—the metallic tang of corruption. Sounds are muffled here, and direction becomes meaningless as the forest seems to shift and change around you.

Navigation through the Dark Wood is nearly impossible. The paths that exist are overgrown and choked with thorns, forcing travelers to either cut their way through or find alternative routes. The trees grow so close together that it's often impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, creating a sense of being trapped in a green maze. The roots of the larger trees break through the ground in places, creating natural trip hazards that wait to catch the unwary. The forest floor itself is uneven and treacherous, covered in a layer of dead leaves and rotting vegetation that hides holes and sudden drops.

The corruption in the Dark Wood goes beyond simple physical change. The very nature of the forest seems to have been perverted, turning it from a place of life into something that exists in opposition to life. Animals avoid the area, their absence creating an unnatural silence that is broken only by sounds that shouldn't exist—the scrape of branches that move when there's no wind, the rustle of leaves that suggests something moving just out of sight, the whisper of voices that might be the wind or might be something else entirely. The Dark Wood doesn't just hide threats—it is a threat, a living thing that watches and waits and hungers.

##### Black Marsh

The Black Marsh is a swampy wasteland where the ground is soft and treacherous, and the water is dark and still. What might once have been a wetland has become a place of rot and stagnation. The marsh is dotted with pools of black water that reflect nothing, their surfaces oily and still. The ground squelches underfoot, and every step feels like it might be your last as the earth threatens to swallow you whole. Dead trees rise from the muck like skeletal fingers, their branches bare and reaching. The air is thick with the smell of decay and the buzzing of insects that seem too large and too aggressive. Mist clings to the ground here, obscuring vision and making every shadow seem like a threat.

The terrain of the Black Marsh is actively hostile. What looks like solid ground might be nothing more than a thin layer of vegetation over deep water or sucking mud. The pools of dark water are deceptive—some are shallow enough to wade through, while others drop suddenly into depths that seem to have no bottom. The vegetation that grows here is twisted and unnatural, with thorns that seem too sharp and leaves that seem too dark. The roots of dead trees break through the surface in places, creating natural barriers that must be navigated carefully or climbed over, their surfaces slippery with mud and decay.

The mist that clings to the marsh seems to move with purpose, coiling around obstacles and pooling in low areas in ways that suggest intelligence rather than natural weather patterns. Visibility is poor even during the day, and at night the mist becomes so thick that it's impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. Sounds are distorted by the water and mist, making it difficult to judge distance or direction. The marsh feels like a place where the normal rules of reality don't apply, where up and down become meaningless concepts and where the distinction between solid ground and open water becomes dangerously blurred. The Black Marsh doesn't just hide dangers—it creates them, transforming the landscape itself into a weapon against those who dare to enter.

##### The Forgotten Tower

The Forgotten Tower rises from the landscape like a broken finger pointing at the sky. Once a place of power and importance, it has been abandoned and left to decay. The stone walls are cracked and weathered, and many of the windows are empty sockets staring out at nothing. The tower's purpose has been lost to time, but its presence still commands attention. Inside, the stairs are treacherous, their steps worn smooth by time and use. The rooms are empty shells, their contents long since looted or destroyed. The higher you climb, the more the tower seems to sway in the wind, and the more you question whether it's the tower moving or the world around it. The top offers a view of the corrupted landscape, a reminder of how far the darkness has spread.

The interior of the tower tells stories of abandonment and violation. The rooms that once served some purpose now stand empty, their walls marked by the evidence of hasty departure or violent entry. Furniture has been overturned and broken, paintings have been torn from walls, and the few personal items that remain speak of lives interrupted. The stairs wind upward in a spiral that seems to go on forever, each landing offering a new perspective on the decay within. The higher levels are worse, their rooms more damaged and their contents more scattered, as if whatever destroyed this place worked its way up from bottom to top.

The tower's height creates a sense of isolation and exposure. The wind howls around the upper levels, making the entire structure groan and sway in ways that suggest it might collapse at any moment. The view from the top is both magnificent and terrible—you can see for miles in every direction, but everything you see is corrupted, ruined, or dying. The tower stands as a monument to something that was lost, but it also serves as a watchtower for whatever darkness now controls the land. Those who climb to the top often find themselves unwilling to descend, held by a strange combination of awe and despair at the view spread out below them. The Forgotten Tower doesn't just show you the landscape—it shows you the truth of what the world has become.

##### The Hole

The Hole is a gaping wound in the earth, a pit that seems to descend into nothingness. The entrance is wide and irregular, as if something tore its way out from below rather than being dug from above. The walls of the pit are rough and uneven, marked by claw marks and strange formations that suggest the rock itself was shaped by something other than natural forces. The air that rises from the depths is warm and foul, carrying the smell of sulfur and something else—something that makes the back of your throat burn. The descent is treacherous, with loose stones and unstable footing. The deeper you go, the more the light from above fades, until you're left with only the darkness and the knowledge that something waits below.

The walls of the Hole reveal its unnatural origin. The marks of claws and teeth are everywhere, gouged into the stone at impossible angles. In places, the rock itself seems to have been melted and reformed, leaving smooth surfaces that gleam oddly in torchlight. The formations that line the walls suggest faces and forms that shouldn't exist in stone—suggestions of eyes and mouths that seem to watch as you pass. The descent requires careful navigation, as the walls are steep and the handholds are few. One misstep can send you sliding downward, with no way to stop until you hit bottom or find something to grab onto.

The deeper you descend, the more the Hole reveals its true nature. The air grows warmer and more foul, carrying with it sounds that might be coming from below or might be echoes of your own movement. The darkness becomes absolute, swallowing light and sound alike. The walls seem to press closer, and the opening above becomes a distant circle of light that might as well be on another world. The Hole is not just a pit—it's a wound in reality itself, a place where the boundary between the world above and whatever lies below has been torn open. Those who descend too far often find themselves unable to return, trapped not by physical barriers but by something deeper—a sense that they've passed a point of no return, and that the world above no longer exists or no longer matters.

##### Tamoe Highland

The Tamoe Highland is an elevated region where the ground rises and the air grows thin. What should be a place of natural beauty has been scarred by the corruption spreading across the land. The highland offers views of the surrounding wilderness, but those views are of a landscape in pain—burned fields, twisted forests, and the ruins of what once was. The ground here is rocky and uneven, with outcroppings that provide both cover and danger. The wind is constant and harsh, carrying with it the smell of smoke and decay from the lands below. The highland feels exposed and vulnerable, as if you're standing on the edge of the world, looking down into an abyss that's slowly consuming everything.

The elevation of the highland creates a sense of isolation that goes beyond mere physical separation. The paths that wind up to the highland are steep and treacherous, forcing travelers to move slowly and carefully. Once you reach the top, the wind hits you with full force, making it difficult to stand upright and nearly impossible to hear anything else. The rocky outcroppings provide some shelter, but they also create blind spots and hiding places where threats can wait unseen. The ground itself is unstable in places, with loose rocks and sudden drops that can catch the unwary.

The view from the highland is both a blessing and a curse. You can see for miles in every direction, giving you advance warning of approaching threats or changes in the landscape. But what you see is a world in pain—corruption spreading like a disease, ruins marking where civilization once stood, and the undeniable evidence that the darkness is winning. The highland offers perspective, but that perspective is one of despair. Those who stand here often find themselves overwhelmed by the scope of the destruction, by the knowledge that what they're seeing is just a small part of a larger horror. The Tamoe Highland doesn't just show you the landscape—it shows you the truth, and sometimes the truth is more than you can bear.

##### The Pit

The Pit is another entrance to the depths, a vertical shaft that plunges into darkness. Unlike the Hole, the Pit feels more deliberate—its walls are straighter, its descent more controlled. But that control is an illusion, for the Pit was clearly not made by human hands. The walls are marked with strange symbols and patterns that seem to writhe when viewed from the corner of the eye. The air is still and heavy, and the silence is absolute—even your own breathing seems loud in the oppressive quiet. The descent is a test of nerve as much as skill, with each step taking you further from the light and closer to whatever waits in the darkness below. The Pit doesn't just lead down—it leads into something else entirely.

The walls of the Pit are covered in symbols that suggest a purpose beyond simple excavation. The marks are too precise, too regular to be the work of natural forces or random digging. They form patterns that might be writing or might be something else—warnings, perhaps, or invitations. The symbols seem to pulse with a faint light when viewed directly, but when you try to focus on them, they fade into darkness. The air in the Pit is different from the air above—heavier, thicker, as if it's been breathed by something that doesn't need oxygen. The silence is so absolute that every sound echoes endlessly, making it impossible to tell if the sounds you hear are real or just the echo of your own movement.

The deeper you descend into the Pit, the more you realize that you're not just going down—you're going somewhere else. The light from above fades slowly, but it's replaced by something else—a faint glow that seems to come from the walls themselves, from the symbols carved into the stone. The temperature changes as you descend, growing warmer in a way that suggests heat from below rather than from above. The air grows thicker, and the silence becomes so absolute that it feels like a physical pressure. The Pit is not just a hole in the ground—it's a gateway, a passage from one world to another, and those who enter often find themselves unable to return to the world they left behind.

##### Monastery Gate

The Monastery Gate stands as the entrance to the Sisters of the Sightless Eye's stronghold, but it is a gate that has been breached. The massive doors hang open, their wood splintered and their metal reinforcements bent and broken. The gatehouse itself is a ruin, its battlements manned by nothing but the wind. The architecture speaks of a time when this was a place of strength and purpose, but now it serves only as a reminder of failure. The gate marks the boundary between the wilderness and the monastery proper, but that boundary has been violated. The corruption has not just reached the gate—it has passed through, and the gate stands as a monument to that failure.

The damage to the gate tells a story of desperate defense and ultimate failure. The doors bear the marks of siege weapons and brute force, their surfaces scarred by impacts that should have been impossible to survive. The gatehouse above is blackened by fire, its battlements shattered by something far more powerful than mere siege engines. The defensive structures that once protected the entrance—murder holes, arrow slits, barricades—now stand empty and broken, their purpose defeated. The gate was meant to be impenetrable, a symbol of the monastery's strength, but it has become a symbol of something else entirely—the impossibility of keeping out darkness when darkness wants to come in.

Passing through the gate feels like crossing a threshold in more ways than one. The architecture changes from the wild, unplanned growth of the wilderness to the deliberate, structured design of the monastery grounds. But that structure has been violated, and the order has been replaced by chaos. The gate itself seems to watch as you pass, its broken doors hanging like open wounds. The air changes too, becoming heavier and more oppressive, as if the weight of what happened here still hangs in the atmosphere. The Monastery Gate is not just an entrance—it's a warning, a reminder that no defense is perfect, and that even the strongest walls can be breached when the enemy is strong enough and determined enough.

##### Outer Cloister

The Outer Cloister is the first courtyard of the monastery, a space that was once a place of peace and contemplation. Now it is a battlefield, scarred by the fighting that took place when the corruption first entered. The courtyard is surrounded by buildings that have been damaged or destroyed, their walls blackened by fire and their windows empty. The ground is uneven, marked by the impact of siege weapons and the scars of battle. The air still carries the smell of smoke and blood, as if the fighting happened only yesterday. The Outer Cloister is a place of transition, marking the boundary between the outside world and the inner sanctum of the monastery. But that boundary has been crossed, and the corruption has taken root.

The evidence of battle is everywhere. The cobblestones that once made a smooth, even surface are now shattered and scattered, replaced by patches of bare earth and deep craters where siege weapons struck. The buildings that surround the courtyard bear the marks of fire and impact, their walls scarred and their roofs collapsed. The garden that once grew in the center is gone, replaced by a patch of dead earth where nothing grows. Statues that once stood as guardians have been toppled, their pieces scattered across the courtyard. The fountain that once provided water now stands dry and broken, its basin cracked and its spout bent at an impossible angle.

The Outer Cloister feels like a place caught between two states—not quite destroyed, but no longer whole. The damage is recent enough that the signs of normal life still remain—a piece of parchment caught under a stone, a broken training dummy still standing in one corner, the remains of a meal left on a windowsill as if someone was interrupted. The air itself seems to hold the memory of what happened here, making every breath taste of smoke and despair. The Outer Cloister is not just a courtyard—it's a graveyard for the hopes and dreams of those who once called this place home, a monument to a war that was lost before it truly began.

##### Barracks

The Barracks were once the home of the monastery's defenders, a place where warriors trained and prepared for battle. Now they stand empty and desecrated, their purpose perverted by the forces that have taken control. The training grounds are littered with broken weapons and discarded armor, the tools of war scattered like children's toys. The living quarters are empty shells, their doors hanging open and their contents ransacked. The air carries the smell of old sweat and something else—the metallic tang of spilled blood that never quite fades. The Barracks speak of a time when the monastery was prepared for war, but they also speak of a war that was lost before it truly began.

The training areas tell stories of interrupted practice. Weapons racks stand empty or hold broken, useless weapons. Training dummies are torn apart, their stuffing scattered across the floor. Practice fields are marked by the footprints of desperate combat, the earth churned and scarred by the movements of warriors fighting for their lives. The armory is empty, its weapons and armor either taken by the defenders as they fled or looted by the invaders. The Barracks were meant to be a place of preparation, but they became a place of last resort, where the final defense was made and lost.

The living quarters are worse, telling stories of lives interrupted. Beds are unmade, personal belongings are scattered, and the signs of normal life remain—a book left open on a table, a letter half-written, a child's drawing pinned to a wall. The Barracks were not just a place to train—they were a home, and the violation of that home is written in every overturned piece of furniture and every broken door. The air is thick with the weight of what happened here, with the knowledge that the people who lived in these rooms are gone, transformed, or worse. The Barracks are not just empty buildings—they're tombs for a way of life that will never return.

##### Jail

The Jail is a place of confinement within the monastery, but it has become something far worse. The cells are empty now, their doors hanging open, but the sense of imprisonment remains. The walls are thick and soundproof, designed to contain whatever was locked away. But those walls have been breached, and whatever was contained has been released—or replaced by something else. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the smell of fear and despair that has soaked into the very stones. The Jail is a place of endings, where hope goes to die and where the worst of humanity—or inhumanity—is given form.

The cells tell stories of desperation and final moments. The walls are marked by scratches and gouges, as if someone tried to claw their way out. Some cells hold the remains of restraints, their chains broken or still holding nothing but dust. Others contain evidence of more recent occupation—blankets that might still be warm, food that hasn't fully rotted, personal items left behind in haste. The Jail was meant to be a place of punishment and reflection, but it has become a place of transformation, where people went in as themselves and came out as something else entirely.

The deeper you go into the Jail, the worse it becomes. The cells become smaller, the air becomes thicker, and the sense of confinement becomes so absolute that it feels like a physical pressure. The soundproofing that was meant to isolate prisoners now serves a different purpose—it isolates everything, making the Jail a place of absolute silence where even your own heartbeat seems too loud. The Jail is not just a prison—it's a processing center, a place where the corruption that has taken hold of the monastery transforms its victims into something that serves its purposes. Those who enter often find themselves unable to leave, not because the doors are locked but because something deeper has changed, and they are no longer who they were when they came in.

##### Inner Cloister

The Inner Cloister is the heart of the monastery, a place that was once reserved for the most sacred of rituals and the most important of ceremonies. Now it stands as a monument to corruption, its sanctity violated and its purpose perverted. The architecture is more elaborate here, with intricate carvings and detailed stonework that speak of the care and devotion that went into its construction. But those carvings have been defaced, and the stonework has been damaged by the forces that have taken control. The Inner Cloister is a place of power, but that power has been twisted to serve dark purposes. The air here is thick with the weight of violated sanctity, and every surface seems to pulse with a malevolent energy.

The sacred spaces within the Inner Cloister have been desecrated. Altars have been overturned, their surfaces marked with symbols that should never have been carved into holy stone. Prayer rooms have been converted into something else entirely, their peaceful spaces now serving purposes that would have horrified those who once used them for contemplation. The intricate carvings that once told stories of faith and devotion have been scratched over or defaced, replaced with marks that speak of darkness and despair. The Inner Cloister was meant to be a place where the divine touched the mortal world, but now it serves as a gateway for something else entirely.

The power that once flowed through the Inner Cloister has been corrupted, twisted from its original purpose into something that serves the darkness. You can feel it in the air—a sense of wrongness that goes beyond simple damage or decay. The walls themselves seem to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, as if something vast and terrible is moving just beyond the stone. The architecture that was meant to inspire awe and reverence now inspires only dread and fear. The Inner Cloister is not just a damaged building—it's a transformed space, a place where the sacred has been replaced by the profane, and where the light has been extinguished in favor of something far worse.

##### Cathedral

The Cathedral is the spiritual center of the monastery, a place that was meant to be a beacon of light in a dark world. Now it stands as a monument to that light's failure. The building is massive and imposing, its architecture designed to inspire awe and reverence. But that awe has been replaced by dread, and that reverence has been replaced by fear. The stained glass windows are shattered, their colors lost to time and violence. The pews are overturned and broken, their wood splintered and scattered. The altar stands at the far end, but it has been defiled, its sanctity violated by forces that should never have been allowed to enter. The Cathedral is a place where faith died, and where something else took its place.

The interior of the Cathedral tells a story of systematic desecration. The pews that once held worshippers now lie broken and scattered, their wood splintered as if by great force. The pulpit has been torn down, its pieces scattered across the floor. The organ that once filled the space with music now stands silent and broken, its pipes bent and its keys smashed. The altar at the far end of the nave has been defiled, its surface carved with symbols that should never have been placed on holy ground. The Cathedral was meant to be a place where the divine presence was strongest, but now it serves as a monument to that presence's absence.

The light in the Cathedral behaves strangely. What little light enters through the shattered windows doesn't seem to illuminate the space properly—instead, it pools in strange ways, leaving vast areas in shadow that seem deeper and darker than they should be. The air is thick with the weight of violated sanctity, making every breath feel heavy and wrong. The silence is absolute and oppressive, broken only by sounds that shouldn't exist—whispers from empty corners, footsteps from empty aisles, the sound of breathing from spaces where no one should be. The Cathedral is not just a damaged building—it's a wound in the fabric of reality itself, a place where the boundary between the sacred and the profane has been torn down, and where something terrible has taken up residence in the space that was once reserved for the divine.

##### Catacombs

Beneath the Cathedral lie the Catacombs, a network of underground passages and chambers where the dead were once laid to rest with honor. But honor has no place here anymore. The passages are narrow and winding, a maze designed to confuse and trap the unwary. The walls are lined with burial niches, most of which are now empty—their occupants having been called back to serve dark purposes. The air is thick with the smell of old bones and embalming spices, but there's something else as well—the metallic tang of necromantic magic that hangs in the air like a curse. The Catacombs are a place of endings, but they are also a place of beginnings—the beginning of something that should never have been allowed to exist.

The layout of the Catacombs was designed to be confusing, a deliberate maze meant to protect the dead from disturbance. But that protection has failed, and the maze now serves a different purpose—to trap the living and deliver them to whatever waits in the depths. The passages wind and turn in ways that defy logic, creating routes that seem to lead nowhere or double back on themselves. The burial niches that line the walls stand empty or contain things that were never meant to be there. The Catacombs were meant to be a final resting place, but they have become something else entirely—a processing center for the dead, where the honored rest is transformed into something that serves the darkness.

The deeper you go into the Catacombs, the more you realize that you're not just in a burial place—you're in something far worse. The air grows thicker and more foul, carrying with it the smell of decay and something else—the smell of magic gone wrong, of rituals that should never have been performed. The walls themselves seem to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, as if something vast is moving just beyond the stone. The silence is absolute and oppressive, broken only by sounds that might be echoes or might be something else entirely. The Catacombs are not just a burial place—they're a womb, giving birth to horrors that should have stayed dead. The deeper you go, the more you understand that this place is not about endings—it's about beginnings, and the thing that's being born here should never have been allowed to exist.

# The Skeletal Triad
Skeleton Warriors, Skeleton Archers, and Skeleton Mages represents the foundational undead forces that stalk the dark corners of Diablo II. Skeleton Warriors are the frontline: reanimated bones held together by necromantic will, advancing with crude swords and shields. Though individually fragile, they swarm with relentless persistence, making them dangerous in numbers. Skeleton Archers lurk just behind them, their bony frames drawing ancient bows to fire volleys of arrows with unnerving accuracy. 


Their attacks force players to maneuver under constant ranged pressure. Skeleton Mages, the most sinister of the trio, hang back and unleash elemental projectiles—cold slowing your advance, fire burning through life, and lightning striking with abrupt ferocity. Together, the triad forms a balanced phalanx of melee, ranged, and magical threats, a classic undead ensemble that showcases the efficiency of necromantic design: simple forms, deadly coordination.

# Corrupted Rogues 
They are the tragic remnants of the Sisters of the Sightless Eye, twisted by demonic influence after Andariel’s invasion of their monastery. The corrupted Rogue attacks with swift melee strikes, her movements jerky and unnatural, driven by a mind no longer her own. 

The Corrupted Archer retains her deadly accuracy, loosing arrows with cold precision, her once-honorable discipline now warped into cruelty. 

The Corrupted Spearwoman fights with relentless aggression, lunging with unnerving speed and coordination that hint at the formidable warrior she used to be. 

All three share the same haunted appearance—ashen skin, darkened eyes, and tattered remnants of the red and black armor worn by the Sisterhood.

### *"And the Evil that once was, shall rise anew..."*

From the blasted plains of the Burning Hells to the haunted catacombs beneath Tristram, **Sanctuary** teems with horrors both ancient and reborn. This tome gathers the fiends, abominations, and restless dead that stalk the mortal realm — from the shambling *Fallen* and *Skeleton Warriors* of Act I, to the corrupted rogues and beasts that serve darker masters still.

:

Every creature within is steeped in the lore of the *Sin War* — twisted by demonic influence, cursed by necromancy, or forged in the fires of Hell itself. Their strength waxes and wanes with the corruption of the land, their presence a reflection of the eternal struggle between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.

:

Journey across crumbling tombs, shadowed forests, and blood-stained keeps as you uncover the monstrous hierarchy of Diablo’s legions. Confront infernal champions, undead mages, and wild beasts warped beyond recognition. Each entry tells of a nightmare reborn — a living echo of the Prime Evils’ endless war upon humanity.

:

Will you stand against the darkness, or will Sanctuary fall once more to despair and flame?

___

**A complete campaign setting and monster compendium for the world of Diablo II.**  

For use with the D&D 5e role-playing ruleset — and for the daring souls who would bring Sanctuary’s horrors to their own campaigns.
