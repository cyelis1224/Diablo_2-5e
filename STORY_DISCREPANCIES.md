# Diablo II Campaign Guide - Story Discrepancies Review

## Summary
After reviewing the D&D campaign guide for Diablo II Act I and comparing it to the original game's story, I found **one significant discrepancy** and several minor inconsistencies that should be addressed.

---

## Major Discrepancy

### 1. Blood Raven's Location - "Monastery Graveyard" vs "Burial Grounds"

**Location in Campaign Guide:**
- Line 1038: Kashya says: *"My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the **Monastery graveyard**!"* and then mentions Blood Raven is there.
- Line 1042: Kashya then clarifies: *"The Burial Grounds are located just off the Cold Plains, northeast of here."*

**Original Diablo II:**
- Blood Raven is found in the **Burial Grounds**, which is located in the **Cold Plains** area
- The Burial Grounds are NOT the Monastery graveyard - they are a separate location
- The Monastery is a different area entirely, accessed much later in Act I

**Issue:**
The campaign guide incorrectly refers to the Burial Grounds as the "Monastery graveyard" in Kashya's initial dialogue. This creates confusion because:
1. The Monastery is a separate location that players don't reach until later in Act I
2. The Burial Grounds are specifically in the Cold Plains, not near the Monastery
3. This could confuse players about the geography and quest progression

**Recommendation:**
Change line 1038 to remove the "Monastery graveyard" reference. The dialogue should say:
- *"My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the Burial Grounds!"* or
- *"My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the graveyard!"* (without specifying "Monastery")

## Minor Inconsistencies / Clarifications Needed

### 2. Quest Structure - Missing Full Write-ups

**Observation:**
- Quest 1 (Den of Evil): ✅ Complete write-up
- Quest 2 (Sisters' Burial Grounds): ✅ Complete write-up  
- Quest 3 (The Search for Cain): ✅ Complete write-up
- Quest 4 (The Forgotten Tower): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found
- Quest 5 (Tools of the Trade): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found
- Quest 6 (Andariel/Sisters to the Slaughter): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found

**Note:** This may be intentional if these quests are meant to be optional or handled differently, but it's worth noting that the original game has all 6 quests as part of Act I.

### 3. Blood Raven's Backstory - Consistent with Original

**Verified:** The campaign guide correctly states that Blood Raven fought against Diablo in Tristram, which matches the original game's lore. This is accurate.

### 4. Quest Order - Matches Original

**Verified:** The quest order (Den of Evil → Blood Raven → Cain → Forgotten Tower → Horadric Malus → Andariel) matches the original Diablo II Act I structure.

### 5. NPC Roles and Dialogue - Generally Accurate

**Verified:** The NPCs (Akara, Kashya, Charsi, Gheed, Warriv, Cain) have appropriate roles and their dialogue generally matches the tone and content of the original game.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the "Monastery graveyard" reference** in Kashya's dialogue (line 1038) to avoid confusion
2. **Consider adding full quest write-ups** for Quests 4, 5, and 6 if they are meant to be part of the main campaign
3. **Verify location consistency** - ensure all references to the Burial Grounds correctly place them in the Cold Plains, not near the Monastery

## Overall Assessment

The campaign guide is **largely faithful** to the original Diablo II Act I story. The main issue is the single reference to "Monastery graveyard" which should be corrected to avoid geographical confusion. The rest of the story elements, character backgrounds, and quest structure align well with the source material.
