# Diablo II Campaign Guide - Story Discrepancies Review

## Summary
After reviewing the D&D campaign guide for Diablo II Act I and comparing it to the original game's story, I found **three significant discrepancies** and have corrected all of them.

---

## Major Discrepancies - ALL FIXED ✅

### 1. Blood Raven's Location - "Monastery Graveyard" vs "Burial Grounds" ✅ FIXED

**Location in Campaign Guide:**
- Line 1038: Kashya said: *"My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the **Monastery graveyard**!"*

**Original Diablo II:**
- Blood Raven is found in the **Burial Grounds**, which is located in the **Cold Plains** area
- The Burial Grounds are NOT the Monastery graveyard - they are a separate location

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Changed "Monastery graveyard" to "Burial Grounds" in Kashya's dialogue

---

### 2. Underground Passage Access - Incorrectly Stated "Only Through Stony Field" ✅ FIXED

**Location in Campaign Guide:**
- Line 1351: Akara said: *"The Tree of Inifuss is located in the Dark Wood, which in turn is accessible **only through the Underground Passage in the Stony Field**."*

**Original Diablo II:**
- The Underground Passage can be accessed from **BOTH** the **Cold Plains** AND the **Stony Field**
- The Underground Passage connects:
  - Cold Plains ↔ Dark Wood
  - Stony Field ↔ Dark Wood

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Updated to clarify that the Underground Passage can be accessed from either Cold Plains or Stony Field. Updated multiple locations:
- Line 1351: Akara's dialogue
- Line 1373: Quest location path
- Line 1378: Quest completion requirements
- Line 1401-1407: "The Journey to Dark Wood" section

### 3. Rakanishu Not Actually Guarding the Cairn Stones ✅ FIXED

**Location in Campaign Guide:**
- Line 1383: Quest objective stated: *"Defeat Rakanishu (guardian of the Cairn Stones)"*
- Line 1539: Akara said Rakanishu "protects" the stones
- Line 1549: Description said Rakanishu "guards the stones, preventing anyone from accessing the portal"

**Original Diablo II:**
- **Rakanishu is NOT guarding the Cairn Stones**
- Rakanishu is a Super Unique Fallen Shaman that spawns randomly in the **Stony Field** area
- He is an optional encounter - players can access and use the Cairn Stones without ever encountering Rakanishu
- The Cairn Stones are not guarded by any specific boss

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Made Rakanishu clearly optional throughout:
- Line 1383: Changed quest objective to mark Rakanishu as "(Optional)"
- Line 1539: Updated Akara's dialogue to clarify stones are not guarded
- Line 1547-1556: Updated encounter description to make it optional
- Line 1661: Updated portal opening text to clarify Rakanishu is not required

## Minor Issues / Clarifications Needed

### 4. Quest Structure - Missing Full Write-ups

**Observation:**
- Quest 1 (Den of Evil): ✅ Complete write-up
- Quest 2 (Sisters' Burial Grounds): ✅ Complete write-up  
- Quest 3 (The Search for Cain): ✅ Complete write-up
- Quest 4 (The Forgotten Tower): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found
- Quest 5 (Tools of the Trade): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found
- Quest 6 (Andariel/Sisters to the Slaughter): ⚠️ Mentioned but no full quest write-up found

**Note:** This may be intentional if these quests are meant to be optional or handled differently. In the original game:
- Quest 4 (Forgotten Tower) is optional
- Quest 5 (Tools of the Trade) is required
- Quest 6 (Sisters to the Slaughter/Andariel) is required

---

## Summary of Changes Made

1. ✅ **Fixed:** Blood Raven location reference (Monastery graveyard → Burial Grounds)
2. ✅ **Fixed:** Underground Passage accessibility (removed "only" and clarified both access points)
3. ✅ **Fixed:** Rakanishu's role (changed from required guardian to optional encounter)

All major discrepancies have been corrected. The campaign guide now accurately reflects the original Diablo II Act I story structure and mechanics.

---

## Overall Assessment

The campaign guide is now **accurate** to the original Diablo II Act I story. All three major discrepancies have been corrected:
1. Blood Raven's location is correctly identified
2. Underground Passage accessibility is accurately described
3. Rakanishu is correctly marked as optional

The guide maintains faithfulness to the source material while adapting it appropriately for D&D 5e gameplay.
